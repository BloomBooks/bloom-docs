A convenient way to customize game themes from within Bloom is not yet available. In the meantime, if you’re comfortable with a bit of technical work “under the hood,” you can use [this online tool](http://tools.bloomlibrary.org/game-theme-editor) to generate custom CSS. Use the “Copy CSS” button to copy the code to your clipboard, then paste it into your `customBookStyles.css` (located in the book folder) or `customCollectionStyles.css` (in the collection folder). Reload the book (or restart Bloom) for your theme to appear as an option.
