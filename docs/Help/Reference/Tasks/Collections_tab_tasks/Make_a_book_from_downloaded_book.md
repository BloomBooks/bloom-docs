## Make a book from a downloaded book

You can [get a book from BloomLibrary.org](../Basic_tasks/Get_a_book_from_BloomLibrary.md). Then, you can use it to make a translated book for your collection. It is expected that you will use the pictures and pages as set in the source book. You may not need to do all the steps in this task.

1.  Click the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/Collections.png) Collections [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md).
    
    -   In the left pane, look below Books From BloomLibrary.org.
        
2.  Click the downloaded book you want to use to make a new book.
    
3.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/addbook2lib.png) MAKE A BOOK USING THIS SOURCE.
    
    The book is added to your collection. It opens in the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/EditTab.png)Edit tab. You see the [Front Cover page](../../Concepts/Front_Cover_page.md).
    
4.  On the [toolbar](../../User_Interface/Toolbar/Edit_tab_toolbar.md), select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Toolbar/CheckedLanguage.png)) languages if the book will use [two or three languages](../../Concepts/Bilingual_or_trilingual_books.md).
    
5.  At the top of the Front Cover page, type the title of the book in the local language.
    
6.  In the Pages pane, click Inside Front Cover and then type information you want to appear on this side of the cover.
    
7.  In the Pages pane, click Title Page:
    
    -   Type any [contribution](../../Concepts/Contributions.md) information made by writers, illustrators, editors and other people.
        
    -   Type words that [acknowledge](../../Concepts/Acknowledgements.md) any funding agency that helped pay for this book.
        
    -   Review the local language and [project information](../../Concepts/Project_Information.md) at the bottom of the page.
        
8.  In the Pages pane, click Credits Page:
    
    -   [Use](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Copyright_License_dialog_box_Text.md) the Copyright and License dialog box to update those metadata for the translated book.
        
    -   Type the name of the translator.
        
    -   Type a translation of the acknowledgements in [language 2](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Languages_tab.md).
        
    -   Review the [ISBN](../../Concepts/ISBN.md) in the ISBN box (if your organization uses them).
        
9.  In the Pages pane, click the next page:
    
    -   Click the text box that will store the local language text.
        
    -   Read the [source text](../../Concepts/Source_text.md).
        
    -   Type a translation of that source text in the local language.
        
    -   If this collection uses a language 3, then type the translation into that language too.
        
    -   Repeat this step for each page.
        
10.  Type any additional information in the [Back Cover pages](../../Concepts/Back_cover_pages.md).
     
11.  On the Title Page, [click](../../Concepts/Title_Page.md) the Paste Image Credits link to update the image information.
     
12.  If the book has a [Translation Instructions](../../Concepts/Translation_Instructions.md) page, follow those instructions.
