## Make a book from a sample shell

It is expected that you will use the pictures and pages that are in the sample shell.

1.  Click the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/Collections.png) Collections [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md).
    
2.  In the left pane, below Sources For New Books, click the sample shell that you will use as the basis of your book.
    
3.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/addbook2lib.png) MAKE A BOOK USING THIS SOURCE.
    
    The book is added. It opens in the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/EditTab.png)Edit tab. You see the [Front Cover page](../../Concepts/Front_Cover_page.md).
    
4.  The remaining steps you need to do depend on what kind of book the sample shell was (basic book, arithmetic and so on).
    

So, find [tasks](../Tasks_overview.md) that match and do the relevant steps.

[Collections tab tasks](Collections_tab_tasks_overview.md) is a good place to start.

5.  If the book has a [Translation Instructions](../../Concepts/Translation_Instructions.md) page, follow those instructions.
