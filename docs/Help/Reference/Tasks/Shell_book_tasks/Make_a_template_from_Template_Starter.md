## Make a template from Template Starter template

-   Review the information in [Template Starter](../../Concepts/Template_Starter.md).
    

The specific content that you include in your template can vary a great deal, so consider some of these steps as possible things you can do. For example, you may or may not want standardized text.

1.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/Collections.png) Collections [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md).
    
2.  [Use](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Settings_dialog_box.md) any of the tabs in the Settings dialog box to specify languages, fonts and other settings.
    
3.  Below Sources For New Books, click the template called Template Starter.
    

A page from the template starter and important How to use the Template Starter information appear in the main pane. Review this information carefully.

4.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/addbook2lib.png) MAKE A BOOK USING THIS SOURCE.
    

The book is added and it opens in the Edit [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Edit_tab_commands.md).

5.  On the [toolbar](../../User_Interface/Toolbar/Edit_tab_toolbar.md), do one or both of these steps:
    
    -   Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Toolbar/CheckedLanguage.png)) languages.
        
    -   [Choose](../Edit_tasks/Choose_page_size_and_orientation.md) a page size and orientation.
        
6.  On the Image For Thumbnail: TemplateStarter Front/Back Matter page, [choose](../Edit_tasks/Change_picture.md) a picture.
    
7.  On the About page, do these steps:
    
    -   Type a title for the template in the Template Title box in each language for which there is a box.
        
    -   Type your name in the Name of Template Creator box.
        
8.  [Add a page](../Edit_tasks/Add_a_page.md).
    

Then, do any of these steps:

1.  -   In the upper-left corner of the page, type a useful page label that describes the layout of the particular page. You may want to look in the Add Page dialog box to see how other pages are labeled in Bloom.
        
    -   Using the Format [dialog box](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Format_dialog_box.md) to set text box formatting.
        
    -   [Use](../Edit_tasks/Using_the_Change_Layout_controls.md) the Change Layout [control](../Edit_tasks/About_the_Change_Layout_controls.md) to [open](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Text_Box_Properties_dialog_box.md) the Text Box Properties dialog box. Â For example, you might want to [add hint bubbles](../Edit_tasks/Using_the_Hint_Bubbles_tab.md).
        
    -   You might want to [duplicate](../Edit_tasks/Duplicate_a_page.md) the page after the layout is set.
        
    -   Type words in the [text boxes](../../Concepts/Text_Box.md) that you want to include in all books made from this template.
        
    -   [Insert a picture](../Edit_tasks/Change_picture.md) that you want to include in all books made from this template.
        
    -   Repeat this step for each page.
        

9.  Optionally, add a description that will appear in the right pane of the Collections tab when someone clicks your template.  
      
    To do this, put a text file named ReadMe-en.md in the folder for your template (where en is English).  
    This file should follow the [markdown standard](http://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/ "http://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/") and can include screenshots. To find your folder, see [Right-click menu commands - Collections tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md).
    

#### Note

-   For a description in another language, make a translated version of that file and change the -en to another language's two letter code (e.g., ReadMe-fr.md for French). It will appear when the UI is [set](../Basic_tasks/Change_User_Interface_language.md) to use that language (e.g. French).
    
-   If you want Add Page to also provide a short description of the page, close Bloom. Then, edit the html for the template in Notepad. You might want to [get more help](../../Overview/Get_More_Help.md).
    
-   The cover pages, title page and credits page are added when you use your template it as a source for a new book.
