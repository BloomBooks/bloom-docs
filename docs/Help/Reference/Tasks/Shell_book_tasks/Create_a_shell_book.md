## Create a shell book for others to use

Do the steps below to make a shell book that other people can use to [make](../Collections_tab_tasks/Collections_tab_tasks_overview.md) books in their collections.

1.  [Open](../Basic_tasks/Open_a_collection.md) the collection that uses the language or languages you want the shell book to have.
    
2.  In the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/Collections.png) Collections [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md), click the appropriate [source](../../Concepts/Sources_For_New_Shells.md).
    

You can click Arithmetic, Basic Book, Big Book or another template or specialized template that was installed with Bloom.

3.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/addbook2lib.png) MAKE A BOOK USING THIS SOURCE.
    

The new book opens in the Edit tab.

4.  [Tasks overview](../Tasks_overview.md) has links to [Collections tab tasks](../Collections_tab_tasks/Collections_tab_tasks_overview.md) and [Edit tab tasks,](../Edit_tasks/Edit_tasks_overview.md) which list steps you can reference.
    

When you are done, minimally, you should have:

4.  -   typed in the appropriate [metadata](../../Concepts/Metadata_in_Bloom.md)
        
    -   [added](../Edit_tasks/Add_a_page.md) all the intended pages
        
    -   added an [Translation Instructions](../../Concepts/Translation_Instructions.md) page with instructions, if you need that page
        
    -   typed in all the [source text](../../Concepts/Source_text.md) in one or more [language](../../Concepts/Bilingual_or_trilingual_books.md)
        
    -   [configured](../Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/Configure_a_style.md)  all the intended [styles](../../Concepts/Styles.md)
        
    -   chosen all the [pictures](../../Concepts/Picture.md) that you want to appear in the published book.
        

5.  Make the shell book available to other people in any of these ways:
    
    -   [Publish](../Publish_tasks/Publish to Web.htm) the shell to BloomLibrary.
        
    -   [Make a Bloom Pack](Make_a_Bloom_Pack.md).
        
    -   [Make a Reader Template Bloom Pack](../Basic_tasks/Make_Reader_Template_BloomPack.md).
        

This allows others to get the shell and [make a book](../Collections_tab_tasks/Collections_tab_tasks_overview.md) from it.
