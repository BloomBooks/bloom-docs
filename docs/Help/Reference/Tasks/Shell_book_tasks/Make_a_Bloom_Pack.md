## Make a Bloom Pack

### Make a Bloom Pack of Shell Books

1.  Click the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/Collections.png) Collections [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md), if it is not already the current tab.
    
2.  In the left pane, click the down arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/WhiteDownArrow.png)) that appears with the collection name and then click Make a Bloom Pack of Shell Books.
    

The Save As dialog box appears.

3.  Click the folder where you want to save the file.
