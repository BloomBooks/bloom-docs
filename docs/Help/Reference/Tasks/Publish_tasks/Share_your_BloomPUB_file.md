## Publish your BloomPUB

Do the steps in [Viewing BloomPUBs on Bloom Reader (Android)](Make_a_BloomPUB_file_overview.md).

Then, do these steps:

1.  At any time, click PREVIEW to see a preview of your book.
    
2.  Text Languages: Select (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBoxGreen.png)) the languages you want to publish.
    
    -   Clear (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/ClearedCheckBoxGreen.png)) the languages you do not want published.
        

The languages that appear here are those [chosen](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Languages_tab.md) in the Settings dialog box and also others that appear in the [source text](../../Concepts/Source_text.md) boxes. In some books you cannot change a selection (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBox_gray.png)).

3.  Talking Book Languages: Select (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBoxGreen.png)) the languages with [audio](../Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/Talking_Book_Tool_overview.md) that you want to publish.
    
    -   Clear (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/ClearedCheckBoxGreen.png)) the languages you do not want published.
        
4.  Features: See [About Book Features](Features.md).
    

If you select (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBoxGreen.png)) Motion Book, the portrait and landscape options appears for your preview. Click landscape to see motion in the preview. In portrait, you can verify other things like the text highlighting in a talking book.
