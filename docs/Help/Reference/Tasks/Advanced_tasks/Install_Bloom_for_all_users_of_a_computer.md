## Install Bloom for all users of a computer

Administrators of computer labs can install Bloom for all users of the machine.

Do these steps:

1.  Use Run as administrator to open the Command Prompt window.
    
2.  Run the installer with the "--allUsers" flag.
    

"--silent" is also supported.

#### Note

-   This will put Bloom in the Program Files(x86) directory.
    
-   Bloom will not attempt to update itself, nor will users be able to cause an update to happen.
