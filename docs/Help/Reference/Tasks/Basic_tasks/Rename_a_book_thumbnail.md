## Rename a book thumbnail

By default, the name in the thumbnail matches the [book title](../../Concepts/Book_Title.md) automatically. However, you can rename the thumbnail separately. Doing this also renames the book folder but does not rename the [book title](../../Concepts/Book_Title.md). This might be helpful if you are organizing books with long titles.

Do these steps in the Collections [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md):

1.  If the book is in a [Team Collection](Team_Collections/Team_Collections_overview.md), check out that book.
    
2.  Click the book thumbnail and then do one of these steps:
    
    -   Press F2.
        
    -   Click the down arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/WhiteDownArrow.png)) and then click Rename Book.
        
        The name in the thumbnail becomes editable. The entire name is selected.
        
3.  Edit the name and then press the Enter key.
    

The thumbnail name (and the names of the files where Bloom stores the book) change. The book title, shown on the [front cover](../../Concepts/Front_Cover_page.md) and [title](../../Concepts/Book_Title.md) pages, does not change.

Some characters you type may not be saved in the name. This is because your computer's operating system does not permit every possible character.  
Illegal characters can include / ? < > \\ : \* | and others.

#### Note

-   If you want the thumbnail name to automatically match the book title again, delete the name and then press the Enter key.
    
-   Optionally, use the Show in File Explorer [command](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md) to see the changed names.
