## Export to Spreadsheet

Currently this feature is a [Bloom Enterprise](../Edit_tasks/Enterprise/EnterpriseRequired.md) feature (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/BloomEnterprise%20button.png)).

Do these steps for the book you want to export to a spreadsheet:

1.  Click the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/Collections.png) Collections [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md).
    
2.  [Right-click](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md) the book or click the down arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/WhiteDownArrow.png)), point to More and then click Export to Spreadsheet.
    

The Export to Spreadsheet [dialog box](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Export_to_Spreadsheet_dialog_box.md) opens.

It shows the target URL to the folder for the export spreadsheet and images.

3.  To change the target folder, click CHOOSE FOLDER.
    
4.  Browse for the folder you want, click it and then click OK.
    
5.  Click EXPORT.
    

The book is saved in an \*.xlsx format and opens automatically. A sub-folder appears in the folder. It contains the images used in the book.

In the spreadsheet, columns exist for different languages. This allows for translation of the text into one or more other languages. Then you can [import](Import_Content_from_Spreadsheet.md) the spreadsheet to add those contents to your book.
