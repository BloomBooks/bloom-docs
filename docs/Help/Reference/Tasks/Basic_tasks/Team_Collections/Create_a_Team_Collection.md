## Create a Team Collection

The steps in this topic assume that you will use Dropbox for your [Team Collection](../../../Concepts/Team_Collection.md). Dropbox is recommended. Google Drive does not currently work with Bloom. The Team Collection [tab](../../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Settings_dialog_box.md) in the Settings dialog box has links to additional documentation ([online](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DOhy7hnmG37NzcQN8oP6NkXW_X3WU7YH4ez_P1hV1mo/edit#heading=h.m6a6ps8wdxru "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DOhy7hnmG37NzcQN8oP6NkXW_X3WU7YH4ez_P1hV1mo/edit#heading=h.m6a6ps8wdxru")). It is possible to use a LAN (Local Area Network) folder instead of Dropbox.

#### Prerequisites

-   Choose who will create the Team Collection.
    

A Team Collection can only be created once and only by one team member, the Team Collection administrator. Bloom will remember who created it. Only that administrator is allowed to modify collection settings.

Any other team members can only [join](Join_a_Team_Collection.md) it.

-   Everyone on the team must have Dropbox installed on their computer (if you will use Dropbox).
    

### Create the Team Collection

1.  Add a dedicated folder for your Team Collection in Dropbox.
    
2.  Open the Bloom collection that is for your team.
    
3.  [Open](../../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Settings_dialog_box.md) the Settings dialog box. Do these steps:
    
    -   Click the Advanced Program Settings tab and select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedCheckBox.png)) Team Collection.
        
    -   Click Restart.
        
4.  After Bloom has re-opened, open the Settings dialog box again.
    
5.  Click the Team Collection tab.
    
6.  Click CREATE A TEAM COLLECTION.
    

The Create a Team Collection dialog box appears.

Do these steps:

-   Click CHOOSE FOLDER. Click the folder that you shared and then click OK.
    
-   Read all the information. Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/CheckedBox.PNG)) each of the statements
    
-   Click CREATE & RESTART.
    

All of the books that are in the collection are copied to a subfolder in the Team Collection folder.

The name of that subfolder will end with \- TC.

7.  Do the steps in [Add someone to a Team Collection](Add_someone_to_a_Team_Collection.md).
    

### Add Administrator Emails

You must be an Administrator to do these steps:

1.  [Open](../../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Settings_dialog_box.md) the Settings dialog box, and then click the Team Collection tab.
    
2.  Click in the Administrator Emails box after the existing administrator, type a comma or a space, and then type the email address of another person you want as a team administrator.
    
3.  Click OK.
    

It will be shared with the rest of the team after you close Bloom. Otherwise, it remains only on your local computer.
