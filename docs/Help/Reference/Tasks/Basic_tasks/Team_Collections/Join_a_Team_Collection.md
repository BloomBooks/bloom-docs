## Join a Team Collection

Team members can do these steps using Dropbox or a LAN (Local Area Network) folder.

If your team will use Dropbox:

-   You must have a Dropbox account.
    
-   You must have downloaded and installed the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/DROPBOXappIcon.png) Dropbox app on your computer.
    
-   The Team Collection administrator has shared the folder.
    
-   You have added the shared folder to the Dropbox folder on your computer.
    

Do these steps:

1.  Close Bloom.
    
2.  On your computer (not in a web browser), open the folder that has the Team Collection.
    

The name of this folder will end in \- TC.

3.  Double-click the file called ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Team_Collections/JoinIcon.png) Join this Team Collection.JoinBloomTC.
    

The Join the Team Collection dialog box appears.

4.  Click JOIN or MERGE & JOIN.
    

#### Tip

-   Here are three situations to consider:
    

-   Only one person has the collection that is about to become the Team Collection. In this case, everyone else gets a linked copy.
    
-   Two or more people already have different versions of the collection, but the team has already sorted out any conflicts and has one master copy they want everyone to have. In this case, everyone else should delete or rename theirs before joining the Team Collection created from the master copy.
    
-   There are several versions of the collection around; the Team Collection should end up with all the books from all of them. In this case, make sure all are named the same, and then MERGE & JOIN will do the job.
