## Add someone to a Team Collection

Only the person who [created](Create_a_Team_Collection.md) the Team Collection, the team collection administrator, can do these steps:

1.  Share the folder that has the team collection with each team member.
    

This folder is typically a subfolder and its name ends with \- TC.

2.  Inform each team member when the folder has been shared and how to access it.
    

Then, they can [join the Team Collection](Join_a_Team_Collection.md).

#### Note

-   A team administrator can [add another administrator](Create_a_Team_Collection.md).Â 
    
-   If the folder is in Dropbox, all team members need to have Dropbox installed.
    

The details of how to share a folder are beyond these Bloom Helps. It also depends on if that folder is in Dropbox or on a LAN (Local Area Network).
