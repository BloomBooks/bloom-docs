## Choose or create a style

On some pages, you can choose [styles](../../../Concepts/Styles.md) or create new styles.

1.  In the [text box](../../../Concepts/Text_Box.md) that you want to change, click the gear icon (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/FontStarBare.png)).
    

The Format dialog box opens.

2.  On the Style Name tab, click the Style box, and then click the style you want to use.
    

If you do not see the style you need, do these steps:

2.  -   Click the Create a new style link.
        
    -   Type a name for the new style in the New Style box, and then click Create.
        

The new style is the current (selected) style so you can [configure it](Configure_a_style.md).

#### Important

-   Not all the styles used in the current book appear in the Style box drop-down list.  
    For example, some styles are only used on cover pages, but not inside pages. Also, some styles like BigWords are used in Picture & Word pages, but not other inside pages.
    

-   [Style](../../../Concepts/Styles.md) names you add can only have alphabetical characters and numbers. You cannot use spaces, hyphens, and so on.
    
-   When you do this task, you may want to [open](../Open_a_collection.md) a book in the [collection](../../../Concepts/Collection.md) where it was created (where it was an original book).
