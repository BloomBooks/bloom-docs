## Create a Bloom collection

1.  [Open](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Open_Create_Collections_dialog_box.md) the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/BloomIcon_red.gif) Open/Create Collections dialog box.
    

2.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/newlibrary.png) Create New Collection.
    

The Create New Bloom Collection [dialog box](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Create_New_Bloom_Collection_dialog_box.md) opens.

3.  In Choose the main language for this collection, start typing the name or code or country for the language.
    

-   If you see the desired language in the list that appears, click it.
    
-   If you see different scripts you can choose, click the one that you want to use. 
    

The BCP 47 Tag can include that script.

-   If the language is not found, click CREATE UNLISTED LANGUAGE to open the Unlisted Language Tag dialog box. Type the name of the language, and select the country where it is spoken.  
    The BCP 47 Tag will include that name and country. Click OK.
    

Later, you can do the steps in [Change or Set languages](Change_languages.md), if necessary.

-   Optionally, click Display this language this way and edit the language name.
    
-   Click Next.
    

4.  In Font and Script, choose the font.
    

-   Then, then select one or both of the check boxes, such as to indicate that the script is written from right to left. If necessary, choose a different default line spacing.
    
-   Click Next.
    

5.  In Give Language Location, edit or enter the country, province or district names if desired. Click Next.
    
6.  In Collection Name, type the name you want to use for the new collection. Click Next. Click Finish.
    

#### Note

-   Dialects of a particular language can be handled as separate collections.
    

In the Create New Bloom Collection dialog box, choose the main language for the collection and then type the name of a dialect in the box with this label:

Display this language this way

Once you have created a collection for each of the dialects, use the Other Collection button to [open](Open_a_collection.md) a collection. You can translate or make books in each collection. Internally, all of your books will use the same language code, but when you are editing in Bloom it will show the name of the dialect.

-   Later, you can make many changes in the Settings [dialog box](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Settings_dialog_box.md).
    
-   When you choose a language, Bloom chooses the primary country of the language as a default. It will not display "alternative names."
