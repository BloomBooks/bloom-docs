## Get a Reader Template Bloom Pack from others

Do these steps to install a Reader Template Bloom Pack that was [distributed](../../Concepts/Bloom_Pack.md) to you:

1.  Copy the Bloom Pack file onto your computer.
    

You can copy into the Bloom folder that is under My Documents. However, you can put it in another convenient folder.

2.  Double-click that file.
    

This installs the shell books and templates, reader settings and words on your computer.

A message box appears and states, "The `<name>` Collection is now ready to use on this computer".

1.  -   Click OK.
        

3.  Close and restart Bloom.
