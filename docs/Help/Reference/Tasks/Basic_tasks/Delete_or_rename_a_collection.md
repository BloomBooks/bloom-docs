## Delete or rename a collection

A folder named Bloom is added to your computer when you install the Bloom program. It contains one or more subfolders. Each of those subfolders is a [collection](../../Concepts/Collection.md).

### Delete a collection

1.  In the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/Collections.png) Collections [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md), right-click a book and then click Show in File Explorer.
    
2.  Leave the computer file browser open, but close Bloom.
    
3.  Go to the Bloom folder:
    

WindowsÂ® - My Documents\\Bloom or Documents\\Bloom

Linux - /home/`<user name>`/Bloom.

4.  Find the subfolder that has the name of the collection that you want to delete.
    
5.  Delete that subfolder.
