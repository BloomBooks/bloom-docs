## Music Tool overview

The ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/MusicToolIcon.png) Music Tool is one of the tools in the [tool box](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md). It allows you to set up background music that plays when a book is viewed in the Bloom Reader app.

You can choose a music file to play and it will continue playing until you get to a page that is set to start a new music file or play no music at all. You can choose music for all pages, including the cover pages.
