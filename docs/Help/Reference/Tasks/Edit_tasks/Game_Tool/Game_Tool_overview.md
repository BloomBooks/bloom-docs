## Game Tool overview

The ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/GameToolIcon.png) Game Tool is one of the tools in the [tool box](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md). Some of the game pages you can [add](../Add_a_page.md) make the Game Tool [appear](Show_the_Game_Tool.md), but not all of them. In addition, some of the game pages do not use all of the features the Game Tool. This is a [Bloom Enterprise](../Enterprise/EnterpriseRequired.md) feature.

When this tool is [shown](Show_the_Game_Tool.md), and if the current game page allows it, you can see various items you can drag onto a game page. Objects to Drag are items that reader can click and drag to a target. Objects that do not Move are fixed in place so the reader cannot move them. [Set up games overview](Set_up_games_overview.md) describes the various controls you see on game pages.

Here are things you can see in the Game Tool tab:

-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/Image_game.png)
    

This adds an image placeholder so you can add an image to the page. There is one that can be dragged by the reader, and one that is fixed in place.

-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/SignLangVideo_game.png)
    

This adds a video placeholder so you can add a sign language video to the page. There is one that can be dragged by the reader, and one that is fixed in place.

-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/WORDobject.png)
    

This adds a placeholder that can hold words and an audio file that will play a sound with the item is touched.

-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/GIF_game.png)
    

This adds a placeholder that can hold a \*.gif image, which can be animated.

-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/SoundButton.png)
    

This adds a placeholder that can hold an audio file that will play a sound with the item is touched.

-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/TargetBox.png)
    

This add a square to the page that you can fill or leave empty. You can add it as a border around other items.

-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/InstructionsOrOtherLabel_game.png) 
    

This adds a text box you can use for instructions or any other information to help the reader. You can add a child bubble to work with it.

-   Theme allows you to choose the color theme for the objects and background.
    
-   Options has these three buttons:
    
-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/KeepSameSELECTED_Game%20.png) Keep all items and targets the same size. In this case, if you resize an image or a target, all of them change size. 
    

![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/KeepSameCLEARED_Game%20.png) in this case, you can resize an image and its target without changing the size of other images or targets.

-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/ShowDragTargetsSELECTED_Game%20.png) Show drag targets during Play. In this case, the people can see the targets that they will drag letters or images into when they play the game.
    

![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/ShowDragTargetsCLEARED_Game%20.png) In this case, the people will not see the target and will just drag and drop the letters or images in a general area when they play the game. 

-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/ShowAnswersSELECTED_Game%20.png) Show Answer even during Play. In this case, the target shows the correct answer. When a person drags a letter or image into the target box, the box disappears. 
    

![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/ShowAnswersCLEARED_Game%20.png) In this case, the targets are empty until a person drags a letter or image into the target box. 

Above some game pages, you can see these controls:

-   Game Setup Mode: Start, Correct, Wrong and Play. You can click these modes to see how the page will appear when the reader is playing the game and the results the reader will see.
