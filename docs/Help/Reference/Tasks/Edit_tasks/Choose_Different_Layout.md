## Choose Different Layout

TheÂ Choose Different Layout command allows you to choose a different layout for an existing page.

1.  In the Pages [pane](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Edit_tab_commands.md), click the page you want to change.
    
2.  Do either of these steps:
    
    -   Click the down arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/DownArrow.png)) that appears just below the page ([example](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Pages_pane_down_arrow_example.md)). Click Choose Different Layout.
        
    -   Right-click that same page. Click Choose Different Layout.
        

The Choose Different Layout dialog box opens.

3.  On the left side of the dialog box, click the page layout that you want to use.
    
4.  On the right side of the dialog box, select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedCheckBox.png)) Change all similar pages in this book to this layout if that is what you want to do.
    
5.  Do one of these steps:
    

1.  -   If the page (or pages) has contents and Bloom determines that converting the page to the layout will cause some contents to be lost, a warning appears. In this case, you can do any of these steps:
        
    -   -   Click outside of the dialog box to close it without making a change.
            
        -   Choose a different layout. If there is no warning, click Use This Layout.
            
        -   Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/CheckedBox.PNG)) Continue anyway. Then, click Use This Layout.  
            Examine the page or pages to learn about the lost contents.
            

3.  -   If the page (or pages) has no contents or Bloom determines that existing contents will fit in the new layout, click Use This Layout.
        

#### Important

-   Change all similar pages in this book to this layout is not available for selection if the new page layout could cause any content (text, image, and so on) to be lost. You can continue anyway, but only for the current page.
    

If you use Change all similar pages in this book to this layout, pages that are similar to the one you clicked in step 1 (above) also change. This suggests that you need to be careful when you choose that page, and also that you may need to repeat all the steps above for each set of non-similar pages.

-   Any custom [text box properties](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Text_Box_Properties_dialog_box.md) you set in the Text Box Properties dialog box are removed when you choose a different layout.
