## Correct sound quality problems on WindowsÂ®10

If you hear a poor sound quality from your Bloom audio books, one possible solution is to disable the audio enhancements.

Your particular computer or audio system installation may be slightly different, but here are the general steps:

1.  Open Hardware and Sound on your computer's Control Panel.
    
2.  Click the Sound link.
    
3.  In the Sound dialog box, Recording tab, right-click your default recording device and then click Properties.
    
4.  Do one of these steps (depending on your computer and audio system installation):
    
    -   Click the Enhancements tab, and then select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/CheckedBox.PNG)) the Disable check box.
        
    -   Click the Advanced tab, and then clear (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/UncheckedBox.PNG)) the Enable Audio enhancements check box (under Signal Enhancements).
        
5.  Click OK.
