## Set playback order

If you have more than one speech bubble or other text on a page, you can set the order that the recorded audio is heard. The default playback order is the order in which you added the speech bubbles, captions and other text boxes. If you did not add them in the desired order you can change the playback order. For example, the spoken lines in a comic book conversation must be heard in the right order for the conversation to be meaningful.

Any recorded [image descriptions](../Image_Description_Tool/Image_Description_Tool_overview.md) are played back first, by default, so typically there is no need to change that. But if you want to hear some other audio first, you can change the playback order for the image description.  In this case, enable (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/OrangeSliderControl.png)) Show Image Descriptions first and then Show playback order buttons.

1.  In the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/TalkingBookToolIcon.png) Talking Book Tool, enable (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/OrangeSliderControl.png)) Show playback order buttons, which is below Advanced.
    

Playback order buttons appear in locations where there is text you can [record](Using_the_Talking_Book_Tool.md) or have already recorded.

When your mouse pointer is over a playback order button, a minus sign (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/ReduceOrder.png)), a plus sign (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/IncreaseOrder.png)) or both is displayed.

2.  Set the order:
    
    -   For the words you want to hear first, click the minus sign until you see the number 1.
        
    -   For the words you want to hear second, click the minus sign until you see the number 2.
        
    -   Continue until each location where there is text shows the desired playback order number.
        
    -   If you changed the playback order of the image description, it will typically play after the other text boxes and overlays.
        

3.  Disable (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/DisabledSliderControl.png)) Show playback order buttons to make other Talking Book Tool features available again.
    
4.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/ListenToWholePage.png) Listen to the whole page to make sure the playback order is correct.
