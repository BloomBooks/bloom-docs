## Advanced controls

You might want to review [Adjust Timings](Adjust_Timings.md) and [Fine-tuning Aeneas Timings](https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/edit-timings "https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/edit-timings") on the Internet before you continue. 

1.  In the Pages [pane](../../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md), click a page that has words in a [text box](../../../Concepts/Text_Box.md).
    

This includes text boxes, captions and speech bubbles [added](../Overlay_Tool/Using_the_Overlay_Tool.md) to images and can include image descriptions. You may want to start with the text box for the book title on the [Front Cover page](../../../Concepts/Front_Cover_page.md).

2.  Click ![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/Advanced_closed.png) Advanced.
    

Consider these options.

-   The ![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/InsertSegmentMarker.png) Insert Segment Marker button is displayed so where you need to manually insert a segment marker, you can click it.
-   Recording Mode: You can select (![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/SelectedAdvancedOption.png)) By Sentence, and then insert segment markers manually. Alternatively, if you want to record all the sentences in a text box at the same time, select (![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/SelectedAdvancedOption.png)) By Whole Text Box. Then you can [adjust timings](Adjust_Timings.md).
    

 ![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/ImportRecordingButton.png) Import Recording is enabled when By Whole Text Box is selected. Click it to find and import an existing audio file for the current text box.

-   Enable (![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/OrangeSliderControl.png)) Show playback order buttons if you need to [set the playback order](Set_playback_order.md). 

Then, disable (![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/DisabledSliderControl.png)) that feature again to make the other Talking Book Tool controls available again.

-   Select (![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/OrangeSliderControl.png)) Show image description if you want to record the [image descriptions](../Image_Description_Tool/Image_Description_Tool_overview.md).

#### Tip

-   Advanced options can selected differently for the different pages in your book.
    
-   You cannot change the Recording Mode selection, after you have recorded text.
    

If you need to change it, click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/ClearButton.png) Clear to delete the current audio recording. 

-   The Play button in the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/MusicToolIcon.png) Music Tool, allows you to hear the relative [volumes](../Music_Tool/Using_the_Music_Tool.md) of the [recorded audio](Talking_Book_Tool_overview.md) and [background music](../Music_Tool/Music_Tool_overview.md).
