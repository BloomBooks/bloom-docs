#### Tip

-   In the audio [folder](../../../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md) for the book, the existing audio file is replaced if there was one.
    

To preserve an audio file for possible future reuse, make a copy and store it in another folder before you use the Import Recording feature.
