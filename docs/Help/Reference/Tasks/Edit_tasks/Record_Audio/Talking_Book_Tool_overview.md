## Talking Book Tool overview

The ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/TalkingBookToolIcon.png) Talking Book Tool is one of the tools in the [tool box](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md).

You can make an audio recording of a book translated into the Local Language.

You can record [image descriptions](../Image_Description_Tool/Image_Description_Tool_overview.md) and [Overlay Tool](../Overlay_Tool/Overlay_Tool_overview.md) bubbles, text blocks and captions.

Recordings can be heard on [ePUB readers](../../../Concepts/Epub_Readers.md) and with the [Bloom Reader App](../../../Concepts/Bloom_Reader_App.md).

If [aeneas](../../../Concepts/aeneas.md) / [eSpeak](../../../Concepts/eSpeak.md) are installed, you can record an entire text box and let Bloom [adjust timings](Adjust_Timings.md) in your recordings by sentence for highlighting. Otherwise, you can only record one sentence at a time.
