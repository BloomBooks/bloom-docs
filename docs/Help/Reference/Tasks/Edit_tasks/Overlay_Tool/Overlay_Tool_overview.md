## Overlay Tool overview ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/BloomEnterpriseServiceICON.png)

The ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/Overlay%20Tool%20Icon.png) Overlay Tool is one of the tools in the [tool box](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md). It is a [Bloom Enterprise](../Enterprise/EnterpriseRequired.md)Â feature.

On [inside pages](../../../Concepts/Inside_pages.md), it allows you to add layers of pictures, videos or text on top of existing content such as a background picture.

You can drag and drop any of these, and then click and drag them or resize them.

-    ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/Image%20place%20holder%20Overlay.png)A picture placeholder holds a picture. Each one has buttons you can use to choose or paste a picture.
    
-    ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/VideoOverlay.png)A video placeholder holds a video, which you record or import with the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Sign_Language_Tool/VideoPlaceHolderSMALLblue.png) Sign Language Tool.
    

You can drag and drop any of these, and then click and drag them or resize them. Then, you can type and format words in them. They give voice to a narrator or to the thoughts or dialog of characters. Or, they add descriptive text to the image.

-    ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/Speach%20Bubble.png) Bubbles have a tail that points to a particular spot on the image, such as the mouth of a person who is speaking.
    
-   Text Blocks have a transparent background so that none of the image is obscured by the block.
    
-   Caption boxes have a solid background that can obscure a portion of the image. However, the words can be more prominent compared to a text block. If you click one and then [select](Using_the_Overlay_Tool.md) Show Tail, a thin line appears as the tail.
    

The Style control lets you change for shape of a bubble. For example, the Ellipse style elongates the bubble compared to Speech style. Or, you can change the type, such as to change a bubble to be a text box or caption.

You can add a child bubble that shares the outside border of another bubble, but has a separate place to type words.

#### Important

-   Overlays are not supported in [ePUB](../../../Concepts/EPUB.md).
    
-   [Source Texts](../../../Concepts/Source_text.md) can appear next to bubbles, text blocks or caption boxes.
    
-   Currently, make sure the [page size and orientation](../../../User_Interface/Toolbar/Edit_tab_toolbar.md) you see when you edit the page is the same as the intended page size and orientation of your book when it has been published.
    

If it is different, the bubbles, text blocks or captions may not be in the same position.

-   You cannot add bubbles, text blocks or caption to the image on the front cover. Instead, they need to be part of the image.
    
-   When the Overlay Tool is open in the tool box, you cannot see the picture [buttons](../../../Concepts/Picture.md).
    
-   Lettering is the term used for adding bubbles and text. Here is one internet site that can help you learn how to make them look professional: [https://blambot.com/pages/lettering-tips](https://blambot.com/pages/lettering-tips "https://blambot.com/pages/lettering-tips").
    
-   [https://blambot.com/collections/all-fonts/dialogue](https://blambot.com/collections/all-fonts/dialogue) and [https://jasonthibault.com/comic-book-fonts/](https://jasonthibault.com/comic-book-fonts/) offer fonts for comic lettering.
