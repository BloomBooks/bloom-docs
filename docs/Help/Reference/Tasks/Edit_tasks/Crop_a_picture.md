## Crop a picture

There are a few different ways to crop picture ([image](../../Concepts/Picture.md)). Controls for cropping an image are included in the controls you see with pictures. Some are described in [Using the Overlay Tool](Overlay_Tool/Using_the_Overlay_Tool.md).

You can also crop an image in the [Image Toolbox](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Image_Toolbox.md).

1.  In the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/EditTab.png)Edit [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md), display the picture ([image](../../Concepts/Picture.md)).
    
2.  Move your mouse pointer over the image. Then, click ![PICTURE](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/ChoosePictureButton.png) (Change Image).
    

The Image Toolbox appears.

3.  In the Image Toolbox, click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/crop.png) Crop. Notice that dark rectangles appear at each edge of the image.
    

Do this for each edge:

3.  -   Click a rectangle and drag it to remove the unwanted part from that edge.
        

Release the mouse button. Look at the image on the right to see the result.

4.  Click OK.
    

#### Tip

-   Only the copy of the image that is in the book is changed. It original image does not change. If you made a mistake, you can [change the picture](Change_picture.md) to get a new copy of the original.
    
-   If you hold your mouse pointer over an image that you see on a page in Bloom, a pop-up windows appears. It gives you [picture information](../../Concepts/Picture.md).
