## Resize a picture

Depending on the book and particular page template, you can change the size of a picture (relative to other pictures or text boxes on the page) in one of these ways.

First, move your mouse pointer over the horizontal edges of adjacent boxes.

-   If your mouse pointer changes to be a double-headed arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/vertical_lines_w_arrows.GIF) or ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/horizontal_lines_w_arrows.GIF)) and a splitter line (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/ResizeHorizontally.png) or ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/ResizeVertical.png)) appears, then you can click and drag that line.
    
-   If you see small squares at the corners of your picture (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/resizesquare.png)), do these steps:
    

1.  Hold your mouse pointer over one of the squares. 
    

The mouse pointer becomes a double-headed arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/doubleheadedresizeimage.png) or ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/doubleheadedresizeimage2.png)).

2.  Click one of the squares and drag it in a direction that makes the picture larger or smaller.
    
3.  Resize other pictures that are near, if needed.  
    If you click the picture itself, instead of a square on the corner of the picture, you can drag the whole picture. This moves the picture, but does not change its size.  
    You cannot drag in picture to another page.
    

#### Important

-   About the smart splitter:
    
-   You can double-click the splitter to make it snap into the position used by the previous page (if the same layout).
    
-   The splitter can snap into these common locations:
    

the position used by the previous page,

the position that matches the proportions of the image,

1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and so on,

square.

-   The splitter moves only by full percentage points.
    
-   If you need more precision, hold down the CTRL key to move by tenths of a percent, ignoring the snap points.
    

This is not the same as setting the maximum image size with the Book Settings [dialog box](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Book_Settings_dialog_box.md).
