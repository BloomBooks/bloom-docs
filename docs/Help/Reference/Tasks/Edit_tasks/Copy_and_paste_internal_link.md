## Copy and paste an internal link

An internal link (hyperlink) allows readers to navigate from one page to another within the same digital book. For example, you might want to make a Table of Contents page.

Internal linking is a [Bloom Enterprise](Enterprise/EnterpriseRequired.md)Â feature.

1.  Click the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/EditTab.png)Edit [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md).
    
2.  In the Pages (left) pane, click the page you want as the destination of a hyperlink.
    
3.  [Right-click](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Edit_tab_commands.md) that same page or click the [down arrow](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Pages_pane_down_arrow_example.md), and then click Copy Hyperlink.
    

The URL (address) to that page is now on your clipboard.

4.  In the Pages pane, click the page that you want to have a hyperlink.
    
5.  Select the desired text (number, word or phrase).
    

The direct formatting panel appears.

6.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/PasteHyperlink.png) (Paste Hyperlink).
    

The text you selected becomes underlined and changes color to show it has the hyperlink.

#### Note

-   You can edit text after you paste the hyperlink.
    
-   If you make mistake or choose to remove the hyperlink from the text, delete the number, word or phrase.
    

Then, type that text again.

-   You cannot use the URL anywhere outside of the digital book that has the destination page.
