## Sample Words tab

In the Set up Decodable Reader Tool dialog box, the Sample Words tab has two controls and two boxes.

-   We are using lists of allowed words to define stages
    

If you select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedRadioButton.png)) this control, the two boxes described below become unavailable.

See: [Allowed words files](Allowed_Words_Files.md).

-   We are using letters with sight words to define stages
    

If you select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedRadioButton.png)) this control, you use these two boxes:

1) Type Words Here

In this box, type words that you want Bloom to suggest. These words are in addition to [sight words](../../../Concepts/Sight_words.md) and to words in the [files](../../../Concepts/About_word_lists_and_sample_texts.md).

2) Place Text Files in Your Sample Texts Folder

You cannot type in this box. This box shows names of files. These are files that were saved in the Sample Texts folder.

Click the Sample Texts Folder link to open the [folder](../../../Concepts/About_word_lists_and_sample_texts.md). Use the file explorer to copy sample texts into the folder. These files must be in UTF-8 format and saved as \*.txt files.
