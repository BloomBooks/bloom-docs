## Add letters to a stage

If you selected (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedRadioButton.png)) We are using letters with sight words to define stages in the Sample Words [tab](Words_tab.md), do these steps.

1.  In the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Decodable_Reader_Tool/Decodable_Reader_Tool_icon.png) Decodable Reader Tool, click the Set up Stages link.
    
2.  In the Set up Decodable Reader Tool dialog box, click the Decodable Stages tab.
    
3.  In the left pane, click the stage.
    

In the right pane, the Previous and New Letters area has a [grid](Example_Previous_and_New_Letters_grid.md) with letters and other word-forming characters.

-   Letter and characters with bold font and a colored border have already been added to a previous stage.
    
-   Letters and characters with a colored background have already been added to the current stage.
    
-   Letters and characters with a normal (light gray) font are available to be added.
    

4.  Click the letters or characters you want to add to the current stage.
    

-   If a letter or character you need is not in the grid, add it in the Letters [tab](Letters_tab.md).
    
-   If the grid shows a letter more than one time, that letter was added more than once in the Letters and Letter Combinations box.
    
-   To remove a letter from the current stage, just click it again. The colored background is removed to tell you that it was removed and is available for adding to another stage.
