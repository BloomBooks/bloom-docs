## Show In Folder

The steps below help you find a video file that appears on the current page. This is similar to the Show in File Explorer command available in the Collections [tab](../../../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md). But Show in folder opens one of the book's subfolders.

1.  In the Pages pane, click the page that has the video you want to find.
    
2.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Sign_Language_Tool/AdvancedTriangle.png) Advanced.
    
3.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Sign_Language_Tool/ShowInFolder.png) Show in folder.
    

The folder that has the video opens in a file explorer window. The video is selected.

#### Note

-   If you click a different video file in the folder, the video on the current page is not replaced when you close the file explorer.
    

Use the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Sign_Language_Tool/ImportVideoIcon.png) [Import](Import_a_video.md) feature to replace a video.
