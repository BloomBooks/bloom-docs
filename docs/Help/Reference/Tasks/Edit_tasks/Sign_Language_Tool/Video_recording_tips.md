## Video recording tips

Here are some things to consider to help you make a high-quality [video](../../../Concepts/Video.md) with the Sign Language Tool.

### Camera

-   A video camera must be connected to your computer.
    

Otherwise, Recording button is disabled.

It should be the highest quality camera that you can use consistently.

-   Position the camera to capture only what you want to video to show. In the Sign Language Tool, you can see what your camera sees before you start recording.
    

Make sure it is mounted in a stable way. If you use the camera built into a laptop or other mobile device, make sure it is on a stable surface.

Be aware of the camera angle.

### Recording location

-   The location should have consistent lighting.
    
-   The location should provide a minimally distracting or inconsistent background.
    

### Duration

-   If your computer has sufficient memory, it may be possible to make a single video that is upwards of 8 minutes or more in duration. In some cases, you may see an Out-of-Memory or similar error.
    

So, it is recommended that you record more videos, which are shorter, instead of long videos.
