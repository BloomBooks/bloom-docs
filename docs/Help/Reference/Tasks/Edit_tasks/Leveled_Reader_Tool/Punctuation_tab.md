## Punctuation tab

For Bloom to accurately determine the [word count](Review_Count_and_Length_information.md) information, it must know all the sentence-ending punctuation. Bloom already knows which characters in the world's languages always mark the end of sentences, but you can add more.

For example, \\u0020 tells Bloom that normal spaces break your sentences.
