## Using the Change Layout controls

[About the Change Layout controls](About_the_Change_Layout_controls.md) describes the Change Layout control (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/ChangeLayoutHiddenLITE.png)).

1.  To insert the first box, do one of these steps:
    
    -   To insert a box for a picture, click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/PictureOnly.png).
        
    -   To insert a box for words, click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/TextOnly.png).
        

2.  To insert another box, click the plus sign that is where you want the new box to appear:![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/InsertUpDown.png) or ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/InsertLefRt.png)
    
    -   If the box is in the wrong location, click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/DeleteGrayX.png) to delete it.
        
    -   Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/PictureOnly.png) to make the new box to hold a [picture](../../Concepts/Picture.md).
        
    -   Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/VideoOnly.png) to make a new box to hold a [video](../../Concepts/Video.md).
        
    -   Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/TextOnly.png) to make the new box hold [words](../../Concepts/Text_Box.md).
        
    -   Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/WidgetOnly.png) to add a box that holds an [HTML Widget](../../Concepts/HTML_Widget.md).
        
3.  To change heights of boxes, move your mouse pointer over the horizontal edges of adjacent boxes. The mouse pointer changes to be a double-headed arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/horizontal_lines_w_arrows.GIF)) and the splitter line (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/ResizeVertical.png)) appears. Click and drag that line.
    
4.  To change widths of boxes, move your mouse pointer over the vertical edges of adjacent boxes. The mouse pointer changes to be a double-headed arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/vertical_lines_w_arrows.GIF)) and the splitter line (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/ResizeHorizontally.png)) appears. Click and drag that line.
    
5.  To change the [language or languages](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Languages_tab.md) that the text box can use, click the gear button (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/TextBoxPropertiesStar.png)). [Use](Using_the_Language_tab.md) the Text Box Properties dialog box.
    
6.  When the boxes you want are in the desired positions, [hide the controls](About_the_Change_Layout_controls.md).
    

Then you can type words, [change formatting](../Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/Formatting_Text_overview.md) and [change pictures](Change_picture.md) and so on.

#### Tip

-   About the smart splitter:
    

-   You can double-click the splitter to make it snap into the position used byÂ the previous page (if the same layout).
    
-   The splitter can snap into these common locations:
    

the position used by the previous page,

the position that matches the proportions of the image,

1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and so on,

square.

-   The splitter moves only by full percentage points.
    
-   If you need more precision, hold down the CTRL key to move by tenths of a percent, ignoring the snap points.
    
-   [Custom template page example](Custom_page_template_example.md) discusses the red line that appears when a text box has too many words.
