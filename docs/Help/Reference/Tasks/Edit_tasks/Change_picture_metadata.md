## Change picture metadata

1.  In the Edit [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md), display the picture ([image](../../Concepts/Picture.md)).
    
2.  Hold your mouse pointer over the image.
    
    -   If there is missing credit, copyright, and license information, click ![PICTURE](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/SetImageInfoONLY.png) or ![PICTURE](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/CopyrightNOT_OKbutton.png).
        
    -   To edit credit, copyright, and license information, click ![PICTURE](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/CopyrightOKbutton.png).
        
    -   Alternately, click ![PICTURE](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/ChoosePictureButton.png) to open the Image Toolbox. Then click the Edit or Set up metadata link.
        

The Copyright and License dialog box appears.

3.  [Use](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Copyright_License_dialog_box_Images.md) the dialog box.
    
4.  If the Picture Intellectual Property Information question box appears:
    
    -   To apply it to all of the pictures in the book, click Yes.
        
    -   To apply it to only the current picture, click No.
        

#### Important

-   Normally, when you select an existing image to use in Bloom and set metadata on it, the metadata is automatically saved in the original image so it will be available if you use that image again.
    

If the program is unable to modify the file (CD, directory or drive for which you do not have write permission, and so on), it will appear to work normally, but the metadata will not be there the next time you select that image.

-   Update the [image credits](../../Concepts/Contributions.md) on the Title Page after you are sure all the metadata is correct.
