## Impairment Visualizer overview

![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Impairment_Visualizer/ImpairmentVisualizerBlueIcon.png) Impairment Visualizer is one of the tools in the [tool box](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md).

Your [images](../../../Concepts/Picture.md) may need to be [accessible](../../Publish_tasks/Accessibility.md) to readers who have visual impairments. This tool simulates how your images would appear to a reader who has cataracts and color blindness.

-   Cataracts are an opacity or clouding of the lens which reduces its transparency.
    
-   Color blindness is a decreased ability to see color or distinguish differences in colors.
    

The Bloom Accessibility Checker dialog box has a check box with this label:

![](/ref-docs-assets/images/UncheckedBox.PNG) No essential information by color.

The Impairment Visualizer can help you determine if you can select it.
