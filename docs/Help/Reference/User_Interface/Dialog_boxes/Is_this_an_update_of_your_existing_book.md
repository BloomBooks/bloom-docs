## Is this an update of your existing book? dialog box

When you [make](../../Tasks/Collections_tab_tasks/Collections_tab_tasks_overview.md) a new book, Bloom generates a unique book ID and assigns it to your book. This ID is an internal identifier which will stay with that book wherever your book is, even if it is [published](../../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Publish to Web.htm) to the [BloomLibrary.org](https://bloomlibrary.org/ "https://bloomlibrary.org/").

If you copied the book folder manually in your computer file explorer and edited the copy, the original and copy will have the same book ID. To prevent that, use [Duplicate (copy) a book](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Duplicate_a_book.md) and this Bloom feature will provide a different book ID for the copy of the book.

When you publish a book, Bloom checks to see if there is an existing book there that has the same book ID. This dialog box appears when BloomLibrary already has a book with this ID.

1.  Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SendRadioButton.png)) one of these options:
    

-   Yes, I want to update this book.
    

In this case, the existing version of the book is removed and replaced with the one you are uploading now.

-   You must have permission to modify the book.
    
-   If the changes includes [branding](../../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Enterprise/Custom_Branding.md), you will see a warning.
    
-   No, these are different books.
    

In this case, the existing book remains in BloomLibrary and Bloom will fix the book ID so you can complete the upload.

2.  Click UPLOAD.
    

#### Important

-   If someone else previously upload the book, and you have permission to modify the book, you can select Change the official uploader (to me). Then you become the uploader for this book.
    
-   ASK FOR HELP allows you to report your problem to the Bloom team and get a response to help you decide what to do.
