To open the Book Settings dialog box, click Book Settings (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Toolbar/BookSettings.png)) in the Edit tab [toolbar](../Toolbar/Edit_tab_toolbar.md). The dialog box has four tabs.

### Cover

-   Select the languages you want to use for the book title.
    
-   Select if you want those languages names to appear near the bottom of the front cover.
    
-   Select if you want to the [topic](../../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Choose_a_topic.md) to appear on the front cover.
    
-   Background Color: Click the color control and then use the [dialog box](Background_Color_dialog_box.md) to choose the desired color.
    

### Content Pages

-   Page Theme: Click the down arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/Downarrow.png)) and then click the theme you want to use [inside pages](../../Concepts/Inside_pages.md) with contents.
    
-   Show Page Numbers: Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedCheckboxBLUE.png)) to see page numbers or clear (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/UncheckedBoxGray.png)) to hide page numbers.
    
-   Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedCheckboxBLUE.png)) the languages you want to show in normal [text boxes](../../Concepts/Text_Box.md). Clear (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/UncheckedBoxGray.png)) any other languages.
    
-   Advanced Layout: Click the down arrow and then click the best Text Padding and Page Gutter options.
    

### BloomPUB

For books you will [publish](../../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Share_your_BloomPUB_file.md) as a [BloomPUB](../../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Digital_publishing_options.md), you can use dialog box to set the maximum size of the images. The size you set here is used for the display of the book on [BloomLibrary.org](https://bloomlibrary.org/ "https://bloomlibrary.org/"). 

Bloom resizes images to the maximum size you set with these goals in mind:

-   Pictures should be easy to view over a poor internet connection.
    
-   Pictures should use less space on phones.
    
-   There should be no noticeable loss of quality.
    

To set the maximum size, simply click and slide the **Resolution** slider  
(![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Toolbar/ResolutionSlider.png)). 

-   Sizes are stated with words: Small, HD, Full HD or 4K. 
    
-   They are also stated by pixels: 600x600, 1280x720, 1920x1080 or 3840x2160.
    

The aspect ratio of your images are not changed.

For example, if you had a rectangular image and you set it to 600x600, the maximum dimension in either direction will be 600 pixels. It will not become square.

### Fonts

The Fonts tab has a table of all the fonts that are used in the current book.

-   The First Page column lists the first page that uses each if the fonts and is a link that open that [page](../../Concepts/Page.md) in the Edit tab.
    
-   If you used a font that cannot be published or is wrong for another reason, you will see a warning.
    

[Configure the style](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/Configure_a_style.md) to use a different font for each warning.
