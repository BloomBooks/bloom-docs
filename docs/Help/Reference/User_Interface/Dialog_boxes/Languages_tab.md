## Languages tab

This tab is in the Settings dialog box. You use it to [change or set languages](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Change_languages.md). Later, you use the [toolbar](../Toolbar/Edit_tab_toolbar.md) to select from these languages if the book will have more than one language.

[Choose](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Change_languages.md) one or more languages.

-   Local Language
    
    This is the language of the intended readers of monolingual books. It is the primary language in [multilingual](../../Concepts/Bilingual_or_trilingual_books.md) books.
    
-   Language 2 (e.g. National Language)
    

This language can be used in different ways. It is used in the front and back matter. Or, it can be used as a content language on [inside pages](../../Concepts/Inside_pages.md), such as in a bilingual book. 

If you want front and back matter to be in the same language as the book inside pages, choose the same language to match the Local Language.

-   Language 3 (e.g. Regional Language) (Optional)
    

If Local Language and Language 2 are the same, you need to choose a Language 3 if you want a [bilingual](../../Concepts/Bilingual_or_trilingual_books.md) book.

-   Sign Language (Optional)
    

You must [choose](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Change_languages.md) a sign language here before you can [publish your sign language book](../../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Publish to Web.htm) to the web.

#### Important

-   The Language [tab](Text_Box_Properties_dialog_box.md) in the Text Box Properties dialog box is where you can choose languages for individual text boxes. This is part of the [Change Layout controls](../../Tasks/Edit_tasks/About_the_Change_Layout_controls.md).
