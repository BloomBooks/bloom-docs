## Translation Instructions

When you [add a page](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Add_a_page.md), the Translation Instructions page is below the heading called Special.

#### About this page

-   Add this page if you need, for example, to inform the authors or translators of the book that the translations must be checked by a consultant.
    

-   The page has a text box that is "language indifferent" or "language agnostic" (not specific to any language in the collection).
    

You need to type or paste the instructions you want others to follow.

-   It appears only in the Edit [tab](../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md).
    
-   You cannot format the text or choose the font specifically for this page.
    
-   It is added as an empty page.
    

-   It does not affect page numbers.
    
-   It is excluded from all published files ([Bloom Reader](Bloom_Reader_App.md), [PDF](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Save_PDF_file.md), and so on).
