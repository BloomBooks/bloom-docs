## Motion Book

Motion Books are books in which otherwise still [pictures](Picture.md) appear to have motion. Normally, they are [Talking Books](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/Talking_Book_Tool_overview.md) to which you add motion.

The motion is a pan and zoom from rectangle 1 to rectangle 2. You see these rectangles when you [use](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/Using_the_Motion_Tool.md) the Motion Tool. You can add this motion to only the first picture on each [inside page](Inside_pages.md).

If you select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/CheckedBox.PNG)) Motion Book when you [send](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Share_your_BloomPUB_file.md) a book to the [Bloom Reader App](Bloom_Reader_App.md), then it has two modes on your device:

-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/Portrait.png) Portrait - When you look at your book in a portrait view, you do not see motion.
    
-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/Landscape.png) Landscape - When you turn the device sideways for a landscape view, pictures fill the screen and you see the motion.
    

For each page, Bloom attempts to match the duration of the motion with the duration of the [recorded audio](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/Talking_Book_Tool_overview.md). If you have not yet recorded a page, or it is very brief, the motion runs for about 4 seconds.

A one-second pause at the end of each page simulates what readers will experience when going to the next page.

#### Note

-   You cannot see the motion in ePUB or PDF publications.
    
-   Motion is included in books when you make a Bloom Pack.
