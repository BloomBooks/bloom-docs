## ePUB Readers

An ePUB reader lets you read a book that was [published](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Digital_publishing_options.md) as an [ePUB](EPUB.md) on electronic devices, such as smart-phones, tablets, computers, and so on.

-   See [https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/ePUB-notes](https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/ePUB-notes "https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/ePUB-notes") to learn about the performance of various ePUB readers.
    

Both fixed and flowable [ePUB modes](EPUB.md) are considered there. 

#### Tip

-   You may learn from the [community](../Overview/Get_More_Help.md) which ePUB readers work best in various situations and the kinds of books you publish.
