## Callout box

Callout boxes provide useful information. Unlike [source text](Source_text.md), this information is not intended for translation into the local language. On some pages, you can [use](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Using_the_Change_Layout_controls.md) the Change Layout controls to type additional words or sentences into these boxes. These are referred to as [Hint Bubbles](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Using_the_Hint_Bubbles_tab.md).

#### Example 1 - Title Page

These yellow boxes inform you regarding what the associated text boxes should contain and the language of that content. If the book as a title in other languages, as shown here, tabs appear so you can see those titles. See Also: [Contributions](Contributions.md).
