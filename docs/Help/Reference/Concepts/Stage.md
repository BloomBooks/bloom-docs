## Stage

In the Decodable Reader Tool, you make groups of [letters](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Decodable_Reader_Tool/Letters_tab.md), [sight words](Sight_words.md) and other [matching words](Matching_words.md).

We call each of these groups a stage. You can introduce words and letters and words in a sequence, one stage at a time.

Stages are numbered.

Stages are cumulative. All the letters and words from stages with lower numbers are included in stages with higher numbers.
