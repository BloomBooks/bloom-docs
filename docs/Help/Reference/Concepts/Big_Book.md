## Big Book

Big Book is one of the [templates](Template.md) that you can use to make a new book or shell book. It is designed for teachers to hold and read in front of students.

The Big Book template has these pages:

-   [Front Cover](Front_Cover_page.md),Â [Credits Page](Credits_Page.md), [Title Page](Title_Page.md), [Instructions](Instructions_page.md) and [Back Cover pages](Back_cover_pages.md).
    
-   You [add](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Add_a_page.md) the [inside pages](Inside_pages.md).
    

In the Add Page dialog box, you can choose one that holds only a [picture](Picture.md), one that only holds words, or a [custom page](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/About_the_Change_Layout_controls.md). The Change Layout [control](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/About_the_Change_Layout_controls.md) can be available in these pages.

### Printing a Big Book

The page is set to A4Landscape. You cannot change it.

Width x Height:

-   A4 is 210 x 297 mm (8.3 x 11.7 in).
    
-   A3 is 297 x 420 mm (11.7 x 16.5 in).
    

Some printers can enlarge your A4 pdf file to the A3 size.

### Limitations of this version

The Instructions page gives an overview about how to use this book. It is in English. If you want to have instructions in a different language, you can delete that text and type a translation. If you send us that translated text, we can include it in a future version of the template.

You can delete this page if you do not want to use it.
