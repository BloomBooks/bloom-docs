## Digital Comic Book Template

Digital Comic Book is one of the [templates](Template.md) you can use when you [use](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/Using_the_Overlay_Tool.md) the Overlay Tool.

When you [add a page](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Add_a_page.md) based on this template, the Digital Comic Book page you can add will have a full page image with no margins, with a text footer over the image.

You put the words for the page in speech bubbles, text blocks or captions. You can move them around on the image.

#### Note

-   Be aware that the front cover page has a black background. As a result, you will not see pictures or lettering that are also black, such as images from the [Art of Reading](../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Image_Toolbox.md).
    
-   Comic books made with this template have a different page order that other books.
    
-   [Overlays](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/Overlay_Tool_overview.md) are not supported in [ePUB](EPUB.md).
