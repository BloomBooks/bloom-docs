## Keyboards

In these Helps, the term keyboard does not refer to the input device (hardware), but to the software that controls which characters are input by the hardware. Languages often have a unique set of characters, so more than one keyboard may be needed.

In some cases, the [Special Character panel](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Using_the_Special_Characters_panel.md) may be enough.

### Considerations

-   Typically, users need a keyboard for only the local language.
    
-   If you will make shell books, you might need a separate keyboard for one or more of the languages of wider communication selected in the [Settings dialog box](../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Settings_dialog_box.md). Manually change the keyboard to match that language of each text box.
    

-   Installing and setting up keyboards is beyond the scope of these Bloom Helps.  
    Refer to your Operating System's Helps or documentation from the source of your keyboard.
    

Keyboards you can use depend on computer operating system you are using and the version of that operating system.

Here are some options:

WindowsÂ® - Set up a keyboard that is available in Windows or from another source, such as one from Keyman.

Linux - Set up a keyboard you add in the Keyboard Layout dialog box, IBus, KMFL or a different keyboarding system.
