## Page

A page is typically defined as one side of a sheet of something printed or written such as a [book](Book.md).

About pages in Bloom:

-   In the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/EditTab.png)Edit [tab](../User_Interface/Tabs/Edit_tab_commands.md), the right pane is called the Pages pane.
    

-   It shows a thumbnail for each page in the current book.
    
-   Different kinds of pages appear with different colored thumbnails.
    
-   Each page has a label that informs you about the kind of page that it is, or it shows a page number.
    
-   There are outside pages ([front cover](Front_Cover_page.md) and [back cover](Back_cover_pages.md) pages) and [inside pages](Inside_pages.md).
    
-   If you click a page, a small [down arrow](../User_Interface/Tabs/Pages_pane_down_arrow_example.md) button appears.
    

-   Pages can have [text boxes](Text_Box.md) or image boxes, or both.
    
-   You can [duplicate a page](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Duplicate_a_page.md) or use [Copy and Paste](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Copy_and_paste_a_page.md).
    
-   Pages can be set to different [page sizes](Page_Size.md).
    

#### Note

The page contents can look different in various [electronic devices](EPUB.md).
