## Book

In these Bloom Helps, the generic term "book" means any document in a [collection](Collection.md).

This can include any of the following:

-   Any book made from a [template](Template.md).
    
-   Any book made from a sample [shell](Shell_book.md) or [downloaded](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Get_a_book_from_BloomLibrary.md) book.
    
-   A [Wall Calendar](Wall_Calendar.md) or [Template Starter](Template_Starter.md).
    

Typically a book is made up of [pages](Page.md).
