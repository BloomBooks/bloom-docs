## ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/Adobe_Digital_EditionsIcon.png) Adobe Digital Editions

You can use Adobe Digital Editions to read books [published](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Publish_tasks_overview.md) in Bloom on a computer. It allows you to listen to the audio recording you made with the Talking Book Tool.

#### Important

-   This reader can work in a satisfactory way for very simple books.
    

However based on user experience, the Microsoft Edge browser works better for most books and is recommended if you read books on WindowsÂ® 10.
