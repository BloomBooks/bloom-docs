## Matching words

In the Decodable Stages tab, the box on the right side can show matching words.

You cannot type in this box. Instead, Bloom adds a word there if it meets at least one of the following conditions:

-   It is a sight word in the current stage or a previous stage.
    
-   It is in a [file](About_word_lists_and_sample_texts.md) or it was typed in the Words tab and uses only [letters](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Decodable_Reader_Tool/Add_letters_to_a_stage.md) that have been [introduced](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Decodable_Reader_Tool/Decodable_Stages_tab.md).
    

Matching words are cumulative. The number of matching words for each stage appears in the box label. Therefore, you should see a larger number as you click later stages.

### Font colors of matching words
