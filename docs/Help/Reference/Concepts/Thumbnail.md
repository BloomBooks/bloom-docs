## Thumbnail

In general, a thumbnail is a very small or concise description, representation or summary. In Bloom, thumbnails are used to show the front cover of the book. Bloom automatically creates thumbnails based on the [front cover](Front_Cover_page.md) image of your book.

Here are things you can do with a thumbnail:

-   In the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/Collections.png) Collections [tab](../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md), you can [update](../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md) or [rename](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Rename_a_book_thumbnail.md) it.
    
-   In the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/PublishTab.png) Publish tab, [choose](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Share_your_BloomPUB_file.md) a thumbnail color when you send your book to the [Bloom Reader app](Bloom_Reader_App.md).
    
-   Create a custom thumbnail for an [epub](EPUB.md). It can include a title and subtitle that overlays a [picture](Picture.md).
    

Do these steps:

1.  Create a custom thumbnail with the largest dimension of at least 256 pixels.Â   
    Some might start with 1200 x 700 pixels. Bloom will reduce it so the largest dimension is 256 pixels.
    
2.  Save that file with this exact name: epub-thumbnail.png.
    
3.  Copy this custom thumbnail to the folder for the book.
    

#### Tip

Here are recommendations to consider for optimal images for an epub.

-   Accepted formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG
    
-   Recommended size: Smaller than 1 MB
    
-   Ideal dimensions for mobile devices:
    
    -   Aspect ratio of 1:1 whenever possible (square images)
        
    -   Aspect ratio of 4:5 for portrait-orientated images
        
    -   Aspect ratio of 4:3 for landscape-oriented images
        
-   Amazon:
    
    -   Minimum dimensions of 2560 pixels (height) x 1600 pixels (width) and a quality of 300 dpi for book cover images.
        
-   Orientation for book cover images:
    
    -   Cover images work best in portrait orientation, not landscape. This way, they suit the screen size of most e-reading devices.
