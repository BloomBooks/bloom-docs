## Information for problem reports

When you encounter a problem, you can [use](../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Report_A_Problem_dialog_box.md) the Report A Problem dialog box to report it.

-   To help us reproduce your problem, include this information:
    
    -   What you were doing, or trying to do, when the problem occurred. Be careful to list your steps so we can do the same.
        
    -   A description of the problem.
        
    -   If you have a [publish](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Publish to Web.htm) problem, get information from the Upload Progress pane.
        
    -   If you have a [Bloom Reader](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Share_your_BloomPUB_file.md) problem, click Copy to Clipboard to get Progress information.
        
-   Continue [using](../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Report_A_Problem_dialog_box.md) the Report A Problem dialog box.
    

#### Important

-   Reports you send via email to issues@bloomlibrary.org are added to our bug-tracking site. Anyone with an account can read your report.
    

If you send a report by email, instead of using the Report A Problem [dialog box](../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Report_A_Problem_dialog_box.md), please include the following:

1.  -   Tell us the version of the Bloom program that you are using.  
        Get this from [About Bloom](../User_Interface/Help_menu/Help_menu.md) which is available on the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Toolbar/HelpButtonBW.png) (Get Help) [menu](../User_Interface/Help_menu/Help_menu.md).
        
    -   Tell us the operating system of your computer (e.g., Windows® 11, 64 bit; Linux 18.04 Bionic).
        

-   You can right-click any [tab](../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md) to measure performance and see results.
    
-   Click the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Toolbar/HelpButtonBW.png) (Get Help) [menu](../User_Interface/Help_menu/Help_menu.md) to learn about log files, if necessary.
    
-   If you want your report to remain private, email your report to private@bloomlibrary.org.
