:::caution

These notes outline the process for correcting a book that has been uploaded to the Bloom Library with the incorrect language code. 

This process is intended for the Bloom Librarian or for a highly experienced Bloom support person with Bloom Enterprise status.

Be sure to use the latest version of Bloom Beta.

:::




Sometimes, a Bloom book is uploaded with incorrect language codes. 


For example, a book in Palaung, Rumai (code ‚Äúrbb‚Äù), is uploaded to Bloom Library, but it was incorrectly tagged as **Burmese** (language code ‚Äú**my**‚Äù).


The following procedure will correct the book's language code.


# Step 1: Download the Book for direct editing  {#be5792fd22eb41318b4fff02992db3b7}


When you sign in to Bloom Library with an account authorized to directly edit a book, Bloom Library will grant you access to directly edit the book.

# Step 2: Change the main language settings to the correct language code {#20f4bb19df12805eac78f5037173db73}


# Step 3: Verify Book Settings {#20f4bb19df1280e1962ff2ea76f3f13d}


In particular, 

- **Content Pages &gt; Languages to show in normal text boxes must** be set to the main language and the incorrect language must be deselected.
- **Cover &gt; Front Cover** should show only the main language.

# Step 4: Export the book to a spreadsheet {#7c22772d905f4513b3bf610a21f8b2fb}


Select the book, and right-click to access the **`Export to Spreadsheet‚Ä¶`** function. 


:::note

This operation requires a Bloom Enterprise subscription.

# Step 5: Unhide row 1 {#49832cb981ed476991eafffe8e72f11d}


Hover your mouse just above the number 2 until you see the symbol pointed to below:


![](./repair-lang-code.ffddad62-f1ef-4120-b6df-942c683a6661.png)


Click and drag the mouse to pull down and reveal row 1. 


# Step 6: Find the columns incorrectly tagged {#4cda02613acc40cbacbc889f7b7293d4}


Potentially, there are three: 

1. a column for the **text**;
2. a column for the **audio**
3. a column for the **audio alignments**

For example;

# Step 7: Correct the language codes and descriptions {#9c99572a64d84f30bc519cbe0122a6f6}


Put in the correct language code and descriptions for all columns incorrectly tagged, for rows 1 and 2. 


For example, change ‚Äúmy‚Äù to ‚Äúrbb‚Äù and ‚Äú·Äó·Äô·Ä¨‚Äù to ‚ÄúPalaung, Rumai‚Äù:


![](./repair-lang-code.28aec35a-620a-4205-8589-fd09c47dda2c.png)


# Step 8: Change the empty column {#afbb740ebcff4ce0805b7bcf72d439a2}


There will be an _empty_ column for the correct/target language. You should see ‚Äú[blank]‚Äù in several of its cells. 


You need to re-tag this empty column to match the original _incorrect_ language tag. The reason for this is to remove all data that was previously incorrectly tagged in the book when you import the spreadsheet back into it.

Deleting this column will not do the trick!

# Step 9: Unhide the xmatter rows {#621524ea9046458abf15508620d9ad5d}


Scroll to the last visible row. You should see a discontinuous number. This indicates there are hidden rows. For example:


![](./repair-lang-code.079cd7b6-8976-4dcc-b1d0-1d9e60f2bd3d.png)


Select the last rows above and below, right-click, and choose Unhide


# Step 10: Verify the xmatter pages {#76b69a52803247748fe719e3c0f8270c}


It‚Äôs hard to predict what you‚Äôll find here, but generally speaking, the credits and licensing should mostly appear in the [*] column, with some other data appearing in the column for whatever national language the book is written in.


# Step 11: Import the spreadsheet {#3d6fa26de1034bb4b6ec80e2fb374ab8}


Import the spreadsheet back into the same book to update it. 


:::caution

Note: a backup of the original book will be placed in: 
`C:\Users\USER NAME\AppData\Local\Temp\bloom pre-import backups`

:::




# Step 12: Verify the book {#bd247ba8e00f4b29922b0c13036424b2}


Verify each page of the book, including audio. 


# Step 13: Upload to Bloom Library {#e62c973ad60040708ecc93e6d1b5b236}


If everything went as expected, under ‚ÄúText Languages‚Äù you should not see the wrong language listed, and the upload should find a match to the original book.
