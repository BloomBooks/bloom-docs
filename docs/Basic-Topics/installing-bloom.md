## Fonts and keyboards {#14b4c74f84664b658f7168630913c7d7}


Bloom assumes that you have a way to type your language on your computer. That will often involve using a certain font. SIL offers a free, high-quality fonts for many scripts on its website at [software.sil.org/fonts](https://software.sil.org/fonts).

<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>

You may also need a special¬†**keyboard layout**¬†to let you type the characters in your language.¬†**Keyman**¬†is a free program from SIL that has many keyboard layouts. You can get Keyman from¬†[keyman.com](https://keyman.com/).

# Troubleshooting {#9bb9718916d34c5fa12c8257ede140fb}


If Bloom does not install properly, try temporarily disabling your computer's anti-virus software. Then try to install Bloom again. It will probably install correctly this time. 


:::caution

Be sure to re-enable the anti-virus software after you have installed Bloom!
