When writing books for people at different levels of reading skill, it is important to choose the right font, font size, line spacing, and word spacing. 


For general guidance on choosing font sizes, setting the number of words per page, and other aspects of leveled book design, see Davidson (2013), [_Books that Children Can Read: Decodable Books and Book Leveling_](https://www.edu-links.org/resources/books-children-can-read).

## Text box styles {#feb4fb1700e64099b661c721f9195918}


All text boxes in Bloom have a **style** that defines the appearance for all of the text in that box. Here are a few example styles:


**Normal** (used for standard text boxes)**:**

### Editing a Style {#1835494c2f8b4a55a73cc35bb2a3be27}


It is also possible to edit a style.


When you edit a style, **all** text boxes in the book with the **same style** will also be modified.


:::note

Editing a style **only** changes the style for **the book you are editing**. It does **NOT** modify the style for the other books in the Collection.

:::




To edit a style:

1. Click on the **gear icon** ⚙ for a text box.
2. Select the style you want to edit from the **Style drop-down**.

:::note

**Why Andika?**  
Bloom uses SIL’s [Andika](https://software.sil.org/andika/) font as its default font. Andika is specially designed with the needs of new readers in mind, and has complete coverage of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts.
If your language uses a **different script**, you can choose a **different font**. SIL publishes freely available fonts for many scripts at [https://software.sil.org/fonts/](https://software.sil.org/fonts/).
