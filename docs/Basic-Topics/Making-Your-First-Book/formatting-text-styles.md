When writing books for people at different levels of reading skill, it is important to choose the right font, font size, line spacing, and word spacing. 


For general guidance on choosing font sizes, setting the number of words per page, and other aspects of leveled book design, see Davidson (2013), [_Books that Children Can Read: Decodable Books and Book Leveling_](https://www.edu-links.org/resources/books-children-can-read).

## Editing a style {#feb4fb1700e64099b661c721f9195918}


All text boxes in Bloom have a **style** that defines the appearance the text will have. It is possible to change that definition. When you change a style, you change it for all boxes in the book with that style. 


:::note

Editing a style changes the style only for the book you are editing. It does not change the style for the other books in the Collection.

:::




To change a style, first **click in a text box on any page.** A blue border will appear around the box, and a small **gear control** will be displayed in the lower-left corner of the box. **Click the gear control.** A style formatting dialog box will appear.

The first tab, **Style Name**, tells us which style you will be editing. You can also select a different style to edit by clicking on the style name and choosing a different style from the list of styles.

To exit the Format Styles dialog box, click anywhere outside the dialog box.

| ❶ | The **Font** control lets you choose the typeface for the style from the fonts installed on your computer. <br/>**Note:** Bloom books are meant to be shared, so Bloom provides guidance on the **licensing** of each font.

:::note

**Why Andika?**  
Bloom uses SIL’s [Andika](https://software.sil.org/andika/) font as its default font. Andika is specially designed with the needs of new readers in mind, and has complete coverage of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. If your language uses a different script, you can choose a different font. SIL publishes freely available fonts for many scripts at [https://software.sil.org/fonts/](https://software.sil.org/fonts/).
