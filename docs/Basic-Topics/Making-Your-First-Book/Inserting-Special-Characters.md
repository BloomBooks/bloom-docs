Your language's alphabet or script may include **special characters**, such as **ā**, **β**, and **ĉ**. Normally, you will already have a way to type such letters on your computer. But if you do not, Bloom provides a convenient way to enter the characters that you need.

:::tip

If your language uses a non-Roman script or regularly uses special characters based on the Roman script, you need a way to type it conveniently. Your operating system may provide a keyboard for your language, or you can use special keyboarding software such as SIL's **Keyman** ([https://keyman.com](https://keyman.com/)).

When you press and hold the key, each Special Character for that base letter is assigned a key, which you can press to insert that character.  The keys are shown at the bottom right corner in each of the special character boxes.

- **Press the keyboard letter that appears in the Special Character box.**

For special characters that you use frequently, you can memorize the key that goes with that character. the memorized action for the special character **ö** would be to press and hold down the **O** key and then press the **E** key.
