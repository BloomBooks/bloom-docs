Bloom lets you print your book in several ways. 


Printing a book in Bloom is a two-step process. First, you use Bloom to create a **PDF** version of your book. A PDF file is a computer file that looks like a printed document, with text and graphics. Then you can print and share your book with others.


## Choose a page size and orientation {#b434d49e12b94563ac526dc97b40fb6d}


To get your book ready to print, first open the book you wish to publish as a PDF.


Then, from the toolbar, select a page size and orientation. Choose a paper size that your printer supports. (In this example, we have chosen **A5Portrait**.)

## The Publish tab {#ba243c4f82814779a43df5ed5840620f}


<div class='notion-row'>
<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.3125)'}}>


Now click on the **Publish tab**. This will show you the Publish tool and the various options for publishing. Bloom gives you many options for publishing your book:


- PDF & Print

- Web (upload to Bloom Library)

We will look at the **PDF & Print** option.
