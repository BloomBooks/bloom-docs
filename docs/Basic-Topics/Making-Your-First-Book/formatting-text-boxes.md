The _Text Box Properties_ dialog box has three separate tabs:

- 
- 
- 

We‚Äôll look at each one below. 


## Text Box Language Settings {#6bc31bd14abe4b5ebbae22534bdb24e2}


Every text box in Bloom is labeled as belonging to a certain language. When you are editing a book in Bloom Editor, Bloom indicates the language of each text box with a light grey ‚Äúlanguage tag‚Äù located in the bottom right of each text box.

When you are making books in Bloom, it is _very_ important that these language tags accurately correspond to the actual language written within each text box.


:::caution

**Make sure the text you type into a text box belongs to the language of the text box!** 
If you are simply printing your book, having inaccurate language tagging will not negatively affect you or anyone else. But if you want to share your book through the [Bloom Library](https://bloomlibrary.org/) üìï, accurate language tagging is crucial so that others will be able to find your book in the correct language category.

You can change the language (or languages) used for the whole book in .


## The Language tab {#807253a78d6f4355b217f2b20af6bdc5}

3. Choose **Normal** to let this field be controlled by the language settings in the Collection settings.
	1. (Note: This is distinct from the ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù [text style](/formatting-text-styles#feb4fb1700e64099b661c721f9195918): this setting in the Language tab will say ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù even if you have the text box set to a different style.)
4. If you want this text box to always display a certain language, choose Language 1, Language 2, or Language 3. (These are the same languages that are listed in the [Collection settings](/8ebe7814-fc9f-4c6f-8890-809347af6dde#cb9073a21d7b4b04be0aaba5884a00e7).)
