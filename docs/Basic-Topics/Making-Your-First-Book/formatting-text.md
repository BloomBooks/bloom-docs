## Formatting selected text {#d54ed7fc181a4263bcc6de863db82652}


Bloom lets you easily make a character, word, or phrase **bold**, italic, underlined, or superscript. You can also set the color of a portion of text. 


:::caution

**Do not use this feature to format** <u>**all**</u> **the text in a textbox!** If you need to format <u>all</u> of the text inside a text box, you should do this by selecting a different text style, or by changing the style characteristics. See [Formatting Text Styles](/formatting-text-styles). 

:::



- **Select the portion of text you want to format.** To select some text, you can double-click a word, or you can put your cursor next to the portion of text you want to select, then click and drag the mouse over the text**.** When you select some text, six buttons will appear.
- **Click the button for the formatting option you want.**

## The formatting buttons {#13abb4a4972b47f0823d22a9e93ab57d}


The first three buttons are typical character formatting buttons. These buttons also have keyboard shortcuts.
