If you come across a software problem when using Bloom, our team wants to know about the problem so we can find a solution for you. 


There are four steps to this process:

1. [Start your error report](/report-problem#742dc066529441c99fd107cc4b5288de)
2. [Report the Problem](/report-problem#bf297e526e6440b69c0788cd0bdf86e8)
3. [Check for an email receipt](/report-problem#d984aa3889d542c98e757b2cef74ba81)
4. [Follow-up with Correspondence](/report-problem#44c3b90994bc469b8cf07c2d2e1fcb14)

# Start your error report {#742dc066529441c99fd107cc4b5288de}


To start the process, you must:

Following this, the **Report a Problem** dialogue will appear.

1. **Describe the problem** in as much detail as you can. For example, which page(s) of your book exhibit(s) the problem?
2. Tell us if the problem happened **only once**, or if it **keeps happening**.
3. Ensure your **email** is **entered** and is **correct.** (Hint: if you registered in Bloom, your email will appear automatically.)

5. Click **`Submit`**.
