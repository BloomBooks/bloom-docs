The following are known problems and limitations in this feature.

## **First Sign Language video skipped in final recording when selecting pages**

When you record an entire SL book, and then playback the recording, all is well.

But if you select a portion of the book, _and_ if there is a SL video on the selected book's 1st page, then that SL video won't _playback_ (even though it seems to be recorded, and plays in the preview).

## Audio in embedded videos is lost when book is turned into an mp3 or video.

[https://issues.bloomlibrary.org/youtrack/issue/BL-11249](https://issues.bloomlibrary.org/youtrack/issue/BL-11249)

Some SL videos contain dubbed audio narration, e.g. <iframe width="100%" height="500px" allow="fullscreen"    allowFullScreen={true}
      src="https://embed.bloomlibrary.org/bloom-player/bloomplayer.htm?url=https://bloomlibrary.org/sign-language/book/XkmlHhNZ7T?lang=ins_url_encoded&initiallyShowAppBar=false&allowToggleAppBar=false"
  ></iframe>

When recording such books in Publish to Video, the audio is lost.
