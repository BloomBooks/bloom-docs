## Publish to Web

 ![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/UploadNewSmall.png) Web is one of the [digital publishing options](Digital_publishing_options.md) you see in the ![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/PublishTab.png) Publish [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Publish_tab_commands.md).

### Prerequisites

-   You need to have access to the Internet.
    
-   If you want your book or collection in a bookshelf, [enter your Subscription Code](../Basic_tasks/Enter_Subscription_Code.md).
    
-   If you will use a custom thumbnail for your book, [add your custom thumbnail file](Add_custom_thumbnail_for_BloomLibrary.md) first.
    
-   The current book will be published, or the collection that it is in will be published. 
    

### Steps

#### Left pane

-   Click ![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/UploadNewSmall.png)  Web.

#### Right pane

-   Text Languages: ![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBox_gray.png) means that those [languages](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Languages_tab.md) selected on the Edit tab [toolbar.](../../User_Interface/Toolbar/Edit_tab_toolbar.md) You cannot change that here.
    

Select (![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBoxGreen.png)) each additional language you want to publish. Clear (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/ClearedCheckBoxGreen.png)) each additional language you do not want published.

If you see (incomplete translation) for a language, clear (![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/ClearedCheckBoxGreen.png)) that language. Otherwise, return to the Edit tab and put text in any empty text boxes.

-   Talking Book Languages: Select (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBoxGreen.png)) each language you want to publish. Clear (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/ClearedCheckBoxGreen.png)) the languages you do not want published.
    
-   Features: See [About Book Features](Features.md).
    
-   Visibility: Select (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBoxGreen.png)) DRAFT if you want the book available only to those with whom you share the URL to the book after you have uploaded it to [https://bloomlibrary.org/](https://bloomlibrary.org/ "https://bloomlibrary.org/"). When the book is no longer a draft, upload it again without selecting this option. Or you can go the Bloom library and clear the Draft check box there to make it public.

### Center pane

-   Do these steps:
    

![1](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/PubToWeb_1.png) Confirm Metadata: Make sure the [metadata](../../Concepts/Metadata_in_Bloom.md) that Bloom added are correct. Type a book summary in the Summary box.

 ![2](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/PubToWeb_2.png) Agreements: Read each statement, and select (![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBoxGreen.png)) them to agree.

![3](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/PubToWeb_3.png) Upload: If what you want to upload is shown in the button (book, collection or folder) click that button.

Otherwise, click the down arrow (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/DownarrowWhite.png)) and then click the option you want.

If Is this an update of your existing book? [dialog box](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Is_this_an_update_of_your_existing_book.md), click one of the two options to tell Bloom if these are the same books or are different books.

Progress of the upload appears. 

When the upload is finished, click Log out of BloomLibrary.org.

#### Tip

-   Once your book is uploaded to the BloomLibrary.org, you will have complete control over the ways other people will have access to your book. To see all of your books, click your avatar and then click My Books. Then, for each book you uploaded, you can choose to _show_ or to _hide_ any of the five standard format options for Bloom Library books:  
    PDF (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/PDF_BLib.png)), EPUB (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/EPUB_BLib.png)), BloomPUB (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/Android_Button_New.png)), Read (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/Read_BLib.png)), Translate (![PIC](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/Translate_BLib.png)). To do this, click Which Format Buttons to Show for this Book control and then choose Show or Hide as desired.
    
    If you update your book in Bloom, you can upload it again to replace your book with the updated version. You can also [delete](../Basic_tasks/Delete_a_book_from_BloomLibrary.md) your book from BloomLibrary.org.
    
-   You can go to the [https://bloomlibrary.org/](https://bloomlibrary.org/ "https://bloomlibrary.org/") and then sign up or log in without opening Bloom.
