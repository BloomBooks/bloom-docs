#### Note

-   The Produce a .bloomshelf file check box is available when a bookshelf is selected in the Book Making [tab](../Basic_tasks/Select_front_matter_or_back_matter_from_a_pack.md) of the Settings [dialog box](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Settings_dialog_box.md).
    

If both check boxes are cleared (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/ClearedCheckBoxGreen.png)) and the Distribution Tag box is empty, a BloomPubs folder is added with all of the books in your collection.

-   If Produce a .bloomshelf file is selected, an additional .bloomshelf file is added to the folder with the books.
