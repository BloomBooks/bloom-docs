## Print

Do the steps in this topic: [Publish to PDF and Print](PDF_and_Print.md).

Then, do these steps:

-   Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Toolbar/PrintTab.png) Print.
    

The Print dialog box appears.

For Booklet Cover and Booklet Insides, the settings you need for your booklet are listed below the Print dialog box. 

Do these steps in the Print dialog box:

1.  Select the printer, choose the number of copies and other print options.
    
2.  Click More settings ![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/MoreSettingsDownArrow.png) and then make sure those settings are all correct.
    
3.  Click Print.
    

#### Important

-   Booklet Cover and Booklet Insides are not available if there is no way to arrange pages using the current [page size and orientation](../Edit_tasks/Choose_page_size_and_orientation.md) in a way that the printed pages can easily be made into a booklet.
    
-   If you see the "page size is not recommended", you must [choose](../Edit_tasks/Choose_page_size_and_orientation.md) a different page size and orientation in the Edit tab.
    
-   You might notice that the page size you set in the Edit tab is not the recommended paper size.
    

For example, if you have an A5 Portrait book, A4 is the paper size you need. This is because A5 pages can be printed two on each side of an A4 sheet of paper in the right order to make a booklet when folded.
