## Publish as Audio or Video

![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/VideoButton.png) Audio or Video in the Publish [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md) has controls you can use to make an audio or video file of the [talking book](../Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/Talking_Book_Tool_overview.md) being read or a video of a [sign language](../Edit_tasks/Sign_Language_Tool/Sign_Language_Tool_overview.md) book. Books can have [music](../Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/Music_Tool_overview.md) and [motion](../Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/Motion_Tool_overview.md).

-   Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/VideoButton.png) Audio or Video.
    

### Options

-   Click the Format down arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/Downarrow.png)) and then click the format you want (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/FaceBook.png) Facebook, ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/Feature%20Phone.png) Feature Phone, ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/YouTube.png) YouTube or ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/MP3.png) Mp3 Audio).
    

![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/MP3unavailable.png) Mp3 Audio is unavailable if there is no [talking book](../Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/Talking_Book_Tool_overview.md) audio.

Information about the video appears in a colored box.

The video size will be based on the format you have selected and limited by the size of your screen.

![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Note_Icon.gif) Note: If your screen is 1920 x 1080 and you chose the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/YouTube.png) YouTube format, there will be no room for a white bar for the recording window and therefore no X in the corner. If you need to stop the recording and close the window, right-click over the recording window.

-   Click and drag the Turn pages without narration after slider (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/TurnPagesSlider.png)) until you see the desired number of seconds.
    
-   If your book has motion, you can select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBoxGreen.png)) Motion Book so the video recording includes that motion.
    
-   Click and drag the Record these pages slider (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/TurnPagesSlider.png)) until you see the desired page number below the slider.
