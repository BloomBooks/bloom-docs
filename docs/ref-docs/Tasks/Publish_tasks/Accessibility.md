## Accessibility

Accessibility is a measure of how well people who are visually impaired can consume the contents of a book (or website and so on). See Also: [About Book Features](Features.md).

For [ePUB](../../Concepts/EPUB.md) books, there are accessibility standards to help ensure consistently accessible books are available for the visually impaired.

Bloom provides [tools](../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md) and controls so you can make and identify accessible books.

-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Image_Description_Tool/ImageDescriptionTool_Blue.png) Image Description Tool - You can write a [description](../Edit_tasks/Image_Description_Tool/Image_Description_Tool_overview.md) of each [image](../../Concepts/Picture.md).
    
-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/TalkingBookToolIcon.png) Talking Book Tool - You can make an [audio recording](../Edit_tasks/Record_Audio/Talking_Book_Tool_overview.md) of the words on each page, including the image descriptions.
    
-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Impairment_Visualizer/ImpairmentVisualizerBlueIcon.png) Impairment Visualizer - You can have Bloom [simulate](../Edit_tasks/Impairment_Visualizer/Impairment_Visualizer_overview.md) how your images would appear to people with various visual impairments.
    
-   ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/BloomIcon_red.gif) Bloom Accessibility Checker - This [checker](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Bloom_Accessibility_Checker_dialog_box.md) compares your book to an accessibility checklist and lists any problem it finds. If [Ace](../../Concepts/Simply_Reading.md) is installed, its automated checker searches the ePUB [generated](Make_an_ePUB_book_overview.md) by Bloom for violations.
    

### Accessibility 

These accessibility controls are in the in the Publish [tab](Publish_tasks_overview.md) when ePUB is selected:

-   Include image descriptions on page
    

This check box is only available for the [ePUB Mode](../../Concepts/EPUB.md) Flowable.

Select (![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBoxGreen.png)) this check box to make an [ePUB](../../Concepts/EPUB.md) in which the [image descriptions](../Edit_tasks/Image_Description_Tool/Image_Description_Tool_overview.md) actually appear on the pages.

This is a way to make the recorded audio of the image descriptions available to visually impaired readers, and it may also be helpful to visually impaired readers.

It may, however, be distracting or annoying to sighted readers. At this time, the only way to deal with that is to make two separate publications; one with (![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/SelectedCheckBoxGreen.png)) and another without (![pic](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/ClearedCheckBoxGreen.png)) image descriptions on the page.
