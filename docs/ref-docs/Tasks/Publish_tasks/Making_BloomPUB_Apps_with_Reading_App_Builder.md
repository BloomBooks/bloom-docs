## Making BloomPUB Apps with Reading App Builder

 ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/Android_Button_New.png) BloomPUB is one of the [digital publishing options](Digital_publishing_options.md). 

Where to begin:

-   [https://software.sil.org/readingappbuilder/download/](https://software.sil.org/readingappbuilder/download/ "https://software.sil.org/readingappbuilder/download/")
    

From this Internet site, you can download the program, and then install it. 

-   [https://software.sil.org/readingappbuilder/resources/](https://software.sil.org/readingappbuilder/resources/ "https://software.sil.org/readingappbuilder/resources/")
    

Here you find documentation, development kits and other resources so you can start building reading apps.

Then, you can [publish](Share_your_BloomPUB_file.md) your book as a BloomPUB and make it available to the app.
