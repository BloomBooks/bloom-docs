## Using the Image Description Tool

Do the steps below to add or edit a description of an image:

1.  In the Pages pane, click an [inside](../../../Concepts/Inside_pages.md) page that has an [image](../../../Concepts/Picture.md).
    
2.  Click the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Image_Description_Tool/ImageDescriptionTool_Blue.png) Image Description Tool tab in the [tool box](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md).
    
3.  Click the text box for the image description, which is next to an image ([example](Image_Description_Tool_example.md)).
    
4.  Read the information in the Image Description Tool to help you decide if the current image actually needs a description.
    
    -   If the image does not need a description, select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedCheckBox.png)) This image should not be described. In this case, this image is allowed to bypass the Accessibility Checker's requirement for an image description.
        
    -   If the image needs a description, do these steps:
        
    -   -   Type or paste a description in one or more language, as available according to the [toolbar](../../../User_Interface/Toolbar/Edit_tab_toolbar.md) selection.
            
        -   Click cogged gear (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/TextBoxPropertiesStar.png)) to [open and use](../../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Format_dialog_box.md) the Format dialog box in one or more text box that has an image description.
            
5.  Repeat the steps above for each image on the page, and for each page that has an image.
    
6.  Click the Talking Book Tool and [record](../Record_Audio/Using_the_Talking_Book_Tool.md) each of the descriptions.
    

#### Tip

-   Click the link to [poet.diagramcenter.org](https://poet.diagramcenter.org/ "https://poet.diagramcenter.org/") to learn how to make effective image descriptions.
    
-   If the Image Description Tool is selected (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/CheckedBoxMorePane.png)) in the tool box, the image descriptions remain in view and are editable even while the Talking Book Tool features are displayed in the tool box.
    

So, you can [record](../Record_Audio/Using_the_Talking_Book_Tool.md) the image descriptions without needed to move between the two tools.

-   You can [choose or create a style](../../Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/Choose_or_create_a_style.md).
    

The default [style](../../../Concepts/Styles.md) for image descriptions is called Image Description Edit.

You may want to create a different style for different languages to help make sure the descriptions fit in the boxes.
