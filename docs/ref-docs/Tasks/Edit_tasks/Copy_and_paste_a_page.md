## Copy and paste a page

[Duplicate Page](Duplicate_a_page.md) copies and immediately pastes a page into the same [book](../../Concepts/Book.md).

Alternatively, you can copy a page to your computer's clipboard. Then, open another book in the same collection and paste the page into that book.

Do these steps after you are done [formatting](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Format_dialog_box.md), [using](Using_the_Change_Layout_controls.md) Change Layout control and [working with](../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Format_dialog_box.md) [styles](../../Concepts/Styles.md).

1.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/Collections.png) Collections [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md).
    
2.  In the left pane, click the book that has the page you want to copy. Then, do one of these steps:
    
    -   Double-click the book.
        
    -   Click the Edit tab.
        
    -   Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/editbook.png)EDIT THIS BOOK.
        

The book opens in the Edit tab.

3.  In the Pages (left) pane, click the page you want to copy.
    
4.  [Right-click](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Edit_tab_commands.md) that same page or click the [down arrow](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Pages_pane_down_arrow_example.md), and then click Copy Page.
    
5.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/Collections.png) Collections tab again.
    
6.  In the left pane, click the book into which you want to paste the page. Then do one of these steps:
    

1.  -   Double-click it.
        
    -   Click the Edit tab.
        
    -   Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/editbook.png)EDIT THIS BOOK.
        

The book opens in the Edit tab.

7.  In the Pages (left) pane, click the page that you want to come before the page you will paste.
    
8.  [Right-click](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Edit_tab_commands.md) that same page or click the [down arrow](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Pages_pane_down_arrow_example.md), and then click Paste Page.
    

A copy of the page you clicked appears in the Pages pane.

If needed, you can [reorder pages](Reorder_pages.md).

#### Important

-   If the page you copied and pasted had an image, Bloom renames the pasted image if the book already had one with the same name.
    
-   Any styles you added or changed are copied into the other book.
    
-   See Also: [Template Starter](../../Concepts/Template_Starter.md).
