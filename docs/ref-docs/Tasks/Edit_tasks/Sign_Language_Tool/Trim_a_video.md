## Trim a video

1.  In the Pages pane, click the page that has a video you want to trim.
    
2.  Click the video you want to trim if the page has more than one.
    
3.  Do the steps below in the Sign Language Tool.
    
    -   Set the start point:  
        Click and slide the left handle (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Sign_Language_Tool/TrimSliderLEFT.png)) to the right while you watch the video.  
        Release your mouse button when you see the desired start point.
        

1.  -   Set the end point:  
        Click and slide the right handle (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Sign_Language_Tool/TrimSliderRIGHT.png)) to the left while you watch the video.  
        Release your mouse button when you see the desired end point.
        

#### Important

-   Compared to [editing](Edit_a_video.md) a video file, trimming (to set the start and end points) does not change the video file as far as Bloom is concerned. So, the size and the duration of the video file that Bloom stores do not change. In the Sign Language Tool, look for Info below ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Sign_Language_Tool/AdvancedTriangleOPEN.png) Advanced to observe this.
    

However, the publishing process will shorten the video that is stored with that particular output ([ePUB](../../Publish_tasks/Make_an_ePUB_book_overview.md), [Bloom Reader](../../../Concepts/Bloom_Reader_App.md) or [published on the web](../../Publish_tasks/Publish to Web.md)) to match the portion of the video remaining between the trim control handles.

-   You can click the Trim slider bar on the left or right of either handle to jump to desired start or end point.
