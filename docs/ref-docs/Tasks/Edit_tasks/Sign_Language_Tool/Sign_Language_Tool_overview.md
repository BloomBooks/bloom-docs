## Sign Language Tool overview

The ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Sign_Language_Tool/VideoPlaceHolderSMALLblue.png) Sign Language Tool is one of the tools in the [tool box](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md).

It is usually used with the Sign Language [template](../../../Concepts/Template.md). But you can use it to work with any page that can hold a [video](../../../Concepts/Video.md).

[Video recording tips](Video_recording_tips.md) discuss ways to help you make high-quality videos. Near the top of the tool a small view windows shows you what your camera sees.
