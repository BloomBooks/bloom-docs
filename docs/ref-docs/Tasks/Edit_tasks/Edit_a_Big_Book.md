## Edit a Big Book

A Big Book was made using a [Big Book](../../Concepts/Big_Book.md) template.

1.  [Edit a book](Edit_a_book.md) has a list of things you can typically do.
    

If the book is in a [Team Collection](../../Concepts/Team_Collection.md), the book must be available for you to [check out](../Basic_tasks/Team_Collections/Team_Collections_overview.md) (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/CHECKOUT.png)).

2.  Edit the Instructions page, if necessary.
