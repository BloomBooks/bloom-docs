## Motion Tool overview

The ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/PanZoomIcon.png) Motion Tool is one of the tools in the [tool box](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md).

More specifically, this tool allows you to set a basic motion to an otherwise still [picture](../../../Concepts/Picture.md). The motion is a pan-and-zoom from rectangle 1 to rectangle 2. You see these rectangles when you [use](Using_the_Motion_Tool.md) the Motion Tool. You can add motion to the first picture on each [inside page](../../../Concepts/Inside_pages.md).

-   [Show the Motion Tool](Show_the_Motion_Tool.md)
    

-   [Using the Motion Tool](Using_the_Motion_Tool.md)
    

#### Tip

-   You can [publish](../../Publish_tasks/Share_your_BloomPUB_file.md) your [motion book](../../../Concepts/Motion_Book.md) to the [Bloom Reader App](../../../Concepts/Bloom_Reader_App.md).
    
-   It is best that you [record the audio](../Record_Audio/Using_the_Talking_Book_Tool.md) before you use this tool. This will help the durations match and the Preview will include the [highlighted text](../Record_Audio/Talking_Book_Tool_Example.md).
    

Similarly, you can also include the [background music](../Music_Tool/Music_Tool_overview.md) when you preview the Motion results.

Using the Preview feature can also help you determine the relative [volume](../Music_Tool/Using_the_Music_Tool.md) levels of the recorded audio and background music.
