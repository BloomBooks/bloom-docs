## Using the Motion Tool

If you have already [recorded audio](../Record_Audio/Talking_Book_Tool_overview.md) and chosen [background music](../Music_Tool/Music_Tool_overview.md), you can include them as part of the Motion Tool preview. For more, see [Audio recording tips](../Record_Audio/Recording_tips.md).

1.  In the Pages pane, click an [inside page](../../../Concepts/Inside_pages.md).
    
2.  Click the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/PanZoomIcon.png) Motion Tool tab in the [tool box](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md).
    
3.  In the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/PanZoomIcon.png) Motion Tool tab, do one of these steps:
    
    -   Clear (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/UncheckedBox.PNG)) the Enable Motion on this page check box if you do not want to add motion the picture on the current page. Then, click another inside page and then do the steps below.
        
    -   Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/CheckedBox.PNG)) the Enable Motion on this page check box if you want to add [motion](Motion_Tool_overview.md) the picture on the current page. Then, do the steps below.
        
4.  Click the picture the shows the rectangles.
    

Rectangle ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/Rectangle1.png) indicates the area in focus when the motion begins.

Rectangle ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/Rectangle2.png) indicates the area in focus when the motion finishes.

5.  Re-position and resize these rectangles as desired:
    

Re-position: Click and drag a rectangle by a numbered corner.

Resize: Click and drag the lower right corner (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/CornerDrag1.png) or ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/CornerDrag2.png)), or move your mouse pointer over a line, and then click and drag a double-headed arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/Rt_Lft%20(1).png) or ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/UpDwn.png)).

If the rectangles do not overlap on any edge, the area between them will be panned with a zoom rate that reflects their relative sizes.

6.  Do these steps to preview the motion:
    

1.  -   Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/CheckedBox.PNG)) Voice if you want to hear the recorded audio during the preview.
        
    -   Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/CheckedBox.PNG)) Music if you want to hear the music during the preview.
        
    -   Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/PreviewButton.png) (Preview) to start a preview.
        

The Preview button (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/PreviewButton.png)) changes to become a pause button (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Motion_Tool/PauseButton.png)).

1.  -   Re-position or resize the rectangles as desired.
        
    -   Repeat these steps until you are satisfied with the motion.
        

7.  Click another page until all of them have motion or a cleared (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/UncheckedBox.PNG)) Enable Motion on this page check box.
    

#### Tip

-   If you change the [page size and orientation](../Choose_page_size_and_orientation.md) or [choose a different layout](../Choose_Different_Layout.md) after you have set the rectangles, you should preview them again. Re-position or resize them if necessary.
    
-   You may notice odd results if only some of the sentences on a page have recorded audio or you have you have cleared and re-recorded the audio for one of the sentences in a paragraph. If you see odd results, clear and record the audio again. Then, re-position or resize the rectangles.
