## Using the Impairment Visualizer

Do these steps to have Bloom [simulate](Impairment_Visualizer_overview.md) visual impairments:

1.  In the Pages pane, click a page that has an [image](../../../Concepts/Picture.md).
    
2.  Click the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Impairment_Visualizer/ImpairmentVisualizerBlueIcon.png) Impairment Visualizer tab in the [tool box](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md).
    
3.  SelectÂ (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Image_Description_Tool/SelectedReminder.png)) one or both of these visual impairments:
    

Cataracts

Color Blindness. Then, select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Impairment_Visualizer/SelectedRadioButton.png)) a type of color blindness.

1.  -   If the image becomes too difficult to see, [choose](../Change_picture.md) a different image. Otherwise, edit the image in an editing tool to change the colors, contrast levels, line densities and so on.
        
    -   Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Impairment_Visualizer/SelectedRadioButton.png)) a different type of color blindness and examine the image again.
        
    -   Click the next page that has an image. Examine the image. Edit or replace each image as necessary.
        

4.  Clear (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/UncheckedBox.PNG)) the check boxes to stop the simulation after you have examined and corrected image problems on all the pages that have an image.
    

#### Note

-   Types (Red-Green, Blue-Yellow or Complete) are described here:

-   Editing images, whether they are line drawing or photographs, are beyond the scope of these Bloom Helps. Numerous sites on the Internet describe and review image editing software.
    
-   No essential information by color is a checklist item in the Bloom Accessibility Checker dialog box.
