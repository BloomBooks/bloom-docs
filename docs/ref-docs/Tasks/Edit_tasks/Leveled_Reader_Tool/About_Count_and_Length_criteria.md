## About Count and Length criteria

You [review](Review_Count_and_Length_information.md) Word Counts, Word Lengths and Sentence Counts in the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Leveled_Reader_Tool/Leveled_Reader_Tool_icon.png) Leveled Reader Tool. These include Max (Maximum) numbers and Actual numbers for the current level. Some are for the current page and others for the current book. Some are averages.

When you [configure a level](Reader_Levels_tab.md) in the Reader Levels [tab](Reader_Levels_tab.md), you choose what you want to see there.

The Reader Levels tab has a table and a list of possible criteria:

-   Each row is a [level](../../../Concepts/Level.md).
    
-   Each column corresponds with one criterion in the list.
    
-   Each cell (the intersection of a row and column) contains a number or a dash (\-).
    

For each criterion you select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedCheckBox.png)) in the list, you must type a number. The number is the maximum count or length for that criteria. It appears in the corresponding cell.

For each criterion you clear (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/UncheckedBox.PNG)) in the list, the cell shows as dash.
