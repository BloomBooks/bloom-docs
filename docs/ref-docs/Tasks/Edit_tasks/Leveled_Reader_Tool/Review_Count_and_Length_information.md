## Review Count and Length information

In the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Leveled_Reader_Tool/Leveled_Reader_Tool_icon.png) Leveled Reader Tool [tab](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md), you see Word Counts, Word Lengths, and Sentence Counts.

[About Count and Length criteria](About_Count_and_Length_criteria.md) describes how you select the count and length criteria, and set Max values when you [set up levels](Set_up_Levels.md).

Here is what you do with the resulting information:

-   Review the count and length numbers and their colors for the [current level](Choose_a_level.md).
    

Numbers in the Actual columns can change color:

1.  -   Green: Actual is less than or equal to Max.
        
    -   Orange: Actual is greater than Max. You need to make word or sentence changes to correct them.
        

#### Note

-   An [orange background](../../../Concepts/Flagged_words_in_reader.md) also appears in sentences that are too long ([example](Example_too_many_words.md)). You need to [edit](../Edit_a_book.md) sentences to reduce the number of words.
    
-   An [orange border](../../../Concepts/Flagged_words_in_reader.md) appears around the page when there are too many words on the page.
    
-   You can click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/CopyLR_stats.png) COPY BOOK STATS to [copy](Copy_Leveled_Reader_statistics.md) them to your clipboard.
