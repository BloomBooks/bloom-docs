## Edit a wall calendar

A wall calendar was made from the [Wall Calendar](../../Concepts/Wall_Calendar.md) template.

-   [Edit a book](Edit_a_book.md) has a list of things you can typically do.
    

If the book is in a [Team Collection](../../Concepts/Team_Collection.md), the book must be available for you to [check out](../Basic_tasks/Team_Collections/Team_Collections_overview.md) (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/CHECKOUT.png)).

You cannot use, and likely do not want to use, all of the tools in the [Tool Box](../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md).
