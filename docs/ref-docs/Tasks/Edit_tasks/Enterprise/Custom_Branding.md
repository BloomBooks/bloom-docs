## Custom Branding

In projects that are creating a set of Bloom books, it is nice to have a consistent set of logos on each book. This is easily done once you have a Custom Branding registered with Bloom and selected for the collection. Bloom automatically displays your logo(s) in one or more locations in printed and electronic books. You can also preset the Copyright and License of each book.
