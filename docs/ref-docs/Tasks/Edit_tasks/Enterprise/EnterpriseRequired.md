#### Important

-   An Enterprise Required message box will appear in the Publish tab if you have one or more books that use Overlay Tool elements. It will not appear if you are translating a [shell book](../../../Concepts/Shell_book.md) with Overlay Tool elements.
    

If you see this message box, you need to [enter your Subscription Code](../../Basic_tasks/Enter_Subscription_Code.md) in the Settings dialog box. Otherwise, [use](../Overlay_Tool/Using_the_Overlay_Tool.md) the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/Overlay%20Tool%20Icon.png) Overlay Tool to delete (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/DeleteBubble.png)) those elements from the book. You might need to [get more help](../../../Overview/Get_More_Help.md).
