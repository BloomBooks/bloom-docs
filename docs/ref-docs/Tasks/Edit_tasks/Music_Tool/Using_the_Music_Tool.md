## Using the Music Tool

1.  In the Pages pane, click the first page.
    
2.  Click the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/MusicToolIcon.png) Music Tool tab in the [tool box](../../../Concepts/Tool_Box.md).
    
3.  In the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/MusicToolIcon.png) Music Tool tab, select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/SelectedRadioButton.png)) No Music or Start new music.
    

4.  To start new music, do these steps:
    

1.  -   Click the Choose link (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/ChooseLink.png)).
        
    -   In the Open dialog box, click the music file that you want and then click Open.
        

The file name appears after the play button (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/PlayButton.png)).

1.  -   Click the play button to hear the music and any [recorded audio](../Record_Audio/Talking_Book_Tool_overview.md) on this page.
        

The play button (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/PlayButton.png)) changes to become a pause button (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/StopButton.png)).

1.  -   Adjust the volume with the slider (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/VolumeControl.png)).
        

This volume slider changes the volume of the music, but not the recorded audio. The numerical value is logarithmically related to the visual slider so that you have finer control at lower volumes.

1.  -   To stop the playback, click the stop button.
        

5.  In the Pages pane, click the next page.
    

If a previous page played music, the default selection is Continue music from previous page.

If you want the music to continue, then click a subsequent page for which you want to have either no music or new music.

1.  -   In the Music Tool tab, select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Music_Tool/SelectedRadioButton.png)) one of these options:
        
    -   -   No Music
            
        -   Start new music.
            

Repeat the steps above to start new music.

6.  Repeat these steps until each page either plays the desired music or is set to play no music at all.
