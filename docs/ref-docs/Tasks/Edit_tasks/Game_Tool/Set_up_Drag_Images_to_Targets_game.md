## Set up the Drag Images to Targets game

#### Note:

-   There is not a Help topic for each possible game page you can [add](../Add_a_page.md). Instead, use this topic as a model. There will be differences but the process is generally similar.
    
-   Review [Game Tool overview](Game_Tool_overview.md) and [Set up games overview](Set_up_games_overview.md).
    

Do any of these steps:

1.  In the Pages pane, click an [inside](../../../Concepts/Inside_pages.md) page that is a Drag Images to Targets page.
    

For this game page, the goal is to allow a reader to click and drag images into targets. Images could be numbers, letters or other things.

2.  Click Start in the Game Setup Mode control, if it is not already selected.
    
3.  In the Game Tool tab, click the item you want to add to the game page and drag it to the place on the page where you want it to appear.
    
4.  Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/ChoosePictureButton.png) to add a background [image](../Change_picture.md) if desired.
    
5.  Do any of the options described in [Set up games overview](Set_up_games_overview.md), including the theme and other options.
    

-   Click and drag the end  ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/ResizeTextBlock.png) or a corner![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/ResizeCorner.png) of an item to resize it, or click and drag the entire item to move it on the page.
    

6.  Click Correct in the Game Setup mode. Use any of the controls to change what the reader sees and hears when they get the correct answer.
    
7.  Click Wrong in the Game Setup mode. Use any of the controls to change what the reader sees and hears when their answer is not correct.
    
8.  Click Play in the Game Setup Mode control, and then play the game.
    

-   Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/CheckResults.png) to check the results from playing the game.
    
-   Click ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/PlayAgain.png) to play the game again.
    
-   Chick ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/Game_Tool/ShowCorrectAnswer.png) to see the correct answers.
    

Then click Start again to continue. Use any of the controls to change the game until it is the game you want readers to experience.
