## Make Bloom suggest words for a decodable reader

Bloom will suggest words (sample words or allowed words) after you [set up](Set_up_Decodable_Reader_Tool_dialog_box.md) the Decodable Reader Tool.

-   If We are using lists of allowed words to define stages is [selected](Words_tab.md), here are the criteria:
    

Each stage is linked to an [allowed words file](Allowed_Words_Files.md).

-   If We are using letters with sight works to define stages is [selected](Words_tab.md), here are the criteria:
    
-   -   You have added [letters](Letters_tab.md) in the Letters tab.
        
    -   You have added and [configured](Decodable_Stages_tab.md) at least one [stage](../../../Concepts/Stage.md).
        
    -   You have added [sample words](Words_tab.md) in at least one of these places:
        

New Sight Words box

More Words box

Sample Texts folder (in [files](../../../Concepts/About_word_lists_and_sample_texts.md)).

#### Tip

Sample words or allowed words are added (cumulatively) up to the current [stage](../../../Concepts/Stage.md). They appear in these places (labels reflect which control is [selected](Words_tab.md)):

-   In the Decodable Stages [tab](Decodable_Stages_tab.md) as [matching words](../../../Concepts/Matching_words.md) or allowed words.
    
-   In the Decodable Reader Tool pane, words appear below Sample words in this stage or Allowed words in this stage.
