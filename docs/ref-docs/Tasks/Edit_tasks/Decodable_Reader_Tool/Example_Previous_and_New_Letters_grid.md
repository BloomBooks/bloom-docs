## Example - Previous and New Letters grid

When you [add letters to a stage](Add_letters_to_a_stage.md), colors and borders can help distinguish the letters.

-   Colored border and bold font mean that the letters were added to a previous stage (a lower stage number).

-   The colored background means that the letters have been added to the current stage (selected).
    

The remaining letters are not yet in any stage and you can click them to add them to the current state.
