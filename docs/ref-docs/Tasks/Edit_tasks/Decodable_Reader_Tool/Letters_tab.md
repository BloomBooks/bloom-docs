## Letters tab

The Letters tab is in the Set up Decodable Reader Tool dialog box. This tab has the Letters and Letters Combinations box.

What you type here becomes available in the Decodable Stages tab.

Type these things in the box:

-   letters in the alphabet for the Local Language ([Languages tab](../../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Languages_tab.md))
    
-   letter-combinations, such as æ, ng, ph or sh
    
-   word-forming characters, such as an apostrophe or glottal stop.
    

#### Important

-   Separate everything you type with a space.
    
-   The letters or word-forming characters you type here and those that are in [files](../../../Concepts/Acknowledgements.md) must match.
    

For example, a single-quote mark is not the same as a word-forming apostrophe.

-   You do not need to use this tab if you will select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedRadioButton.png)) We are using lists of allowed words to define stages in the Sample Words [tab](Words_tab.md).
    
-   You can set the minimum font size for letters and words that appear in the tool box and its related dialog boxes. In the Boom Making tab of the Settings dialog box, click Special Script Settings for the language and then [use](../../Basic_tasks/Select_front_matter_or_back_matter_from_a_pack.md) the Font size when displayed in tools control.
