# Install Bloom without Internet access

If there is no internet access where Bloom will be used, advanced users who have Internet access can save the installer and other items on a USB Flash Drive (or equivalent). Then, they can install Bloom where there is no Internet Access.

Here is an outline of things to do for computers that use Windows®:

1.  Insert the USB Flash Drive in a computer that has Internet Access.
    
2.  Download the Bloom installer from [https://bloomlibrary.org/page/resources/downloads](https://bloomlibrary.org/page/resources/downloads "https://bloomlibrary.org/page/resources/downloads").
    
    -   Save the downloaded file on the USB Flash Drive.
        
3.  If you do not have the Art of Reading package on a CD-ROM, download it from [https://bloomlibrary.org/artofreading](https://bloomlibrary.org/artofreading "https://bloomlibrary.org/artofreading").
    
    -   Save the downloaded file on the USB Flash Drive.
        
4.  Download the recommended fonts (below).
    
    -   Save them on the USB Flash Drive.
        
5.  If source books are needed, do these steps:
    
    -   [Create](../Basic_tasks/Create_a_Bloom_collection.md) a new [collection](../../Concepts/Collection.md).
        
    -   [Get](../Basic_tasks/Get_a_book_from_BloomLibrary.md) books from BloomLibrary.org into that collection.
        
    -   Copy books from another computer into that collection.
        
    -   [Copy](../Basic_tasks/Copy_a_collection_to_another_computer.md) the collection to the USB Flash Drive. Alternatively, make a [Bloom Pack](../../Concepts/Bloom_Pack.md) and save it on the USB Flash Drive.
        
6.  Bloom assumes that you already have a way to type your language. If you need a way to type your language and lack one, you might consider Keyman. It has a free edition.
    

If desired, download Keyman and a keyboard from [https://keyman.com/desktop/download.php](https://keyman.com/desktop/download.php "https://keyman.com/desktop/download.php").

Save those files to the USB Flash Drive.

7.  When all the items are on the USB Flash Drive, insert it in another computer.
    

Run each of the installers and copy the files to the appropriate folders. See [Get shell books from others](../Basic_tasks/Get_shell_books_from_others.md), if you used a Bloom Pack for sources books.

### Recommended fonts

Bloom installs SIL’s Andika font. It was designed specifically for easier reading in roman scripts. You can also use a font you already have installed on your computer, but it must be a Unicode font. SIL offers free Unicode fonts for a variety of needs:

-   Andika - designed for literacy materials, especially for beginning readers.

-   Annapurna - for languages that use Devanagari script.
    

[https://software.sil.org/annapurna/download/](https://software.sil.org/annapurna/download/ "https://software.sil.org/annapurna/download/")

-   Scheherazade - an extended Arabic script font.

-   Abyssinica - an Ethiopic script font (also sometimes called “fidel” script).
