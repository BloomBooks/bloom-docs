## Right-to-left languages

You can use Bloom to make books that use right-to-left languages. You need to set up Bloom and also set up a [keyboard](../../Concepts/Keyboards.md) so you can type the characters.

### Set up Bloom

Do these steps in the [Book Making tab](Select_front_matter_or_back_matter_from_a_pack.md):

1.  Choose the default [font](../../Concepts/Font.md) that can display the characters for the language.
    
2.  Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/CheckedBox.PNG)) the Right to Left Writing System check box for the left to right language.
    

### Keyboards

-   [Keyboards](../../Concepts/Keyboards.md) discusses some options you can consider.
