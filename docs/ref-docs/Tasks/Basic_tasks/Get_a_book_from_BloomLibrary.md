## Get a book from BloomLibrary.org

BloomLibrary.org has books that others have [published to the web](../Publish_tasks/Publish to Web.md). You can download a book and [make a book from it](../Collections_tab_tasks/Make_a_book_from_downloaded_book.md). If it has audio, that audio is also downloaded as part of the shell book.

#### Prerequisites

-   You need to have an Internet connection.
    

Do these steps:

1.  Click the Collections [tab](../Collections_tab_tasks/Collections_tab_tasks_overview.md).
    
2.  Click the link called GET MORE SOURCE BOOKS FROM BLOOMLIBRARY.ORG.
    
    The Internet site opens to [https://bloomlibrary.org/read](https://bloomlibrary.org/read "https://bloomlibrary.org/read").
    
3.  Use the search box to find a book.
    
4.  You can read it.
    

If the author allowed these options, you can also:

-   Download it into Bloom.
    
-   Download it as a PDF, EPUB or BloomPUBÂ file.
    

#### Note

-   Here are [videos](../../FAQ/Instructional_Videos.md) to help you learn about downloading and then using shell books:
