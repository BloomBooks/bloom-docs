## Resize Panes

You can resize the entire Bloom window in any of these ways:

-   Use the Maximize (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/MaximizeButton.png)) and Restore Down (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/RestoreDownButton.png)) buttons that are located in the top title bar.
    
-   Click and drag an edge of the Bloom window.
    

You can also resize panes that appear in the various [tabs](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md). You can move horizontal lines or vertical lines.

1.  Move a horizontal line up or down:
    
    -   Hold your mouse pointer over the horizontal line. It will become a double-headed arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/horizontal_lines_w_arrows.GIF)).
        
    -   Click and drag the line up or down.
        
        The sizes of the top and bottom portions of the pane change size within the Bloom window.
        
2.  Move a vertical line:
    
    -   Hold your mouse pointer over the vertical line. It will become a double-headed arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/vertical_lines_w_arrows.GIF)).
        
    -   Click and drag the line to the left or to the right.
        
        The sizes of the two adjacent panes change size within the Bloom window.
        

#### Note

-   When you try to drag a line, you need to click and hold your left mouse button down.
    
-   Scroll bars appear when there is more content than the available pane or window space can display.
    
-   You can [click a predefined size](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md) for the Bloom window.
