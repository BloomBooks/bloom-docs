## Get shell books from others

Do these steps to install a basic Bloom Pack that was [distributed](../../Concepts/Bloom_Pack.md) to you:

1.  Copy the Bloom Pack file onto your computer.

You can copy into the Bloom folder that is under My Documents. However, you can put in another convenient folder.

2.  Double-click that file.

This installs the shell books and templates on your computer.

A message box appears and states, "The `<name>` Collection is now ready to use on this computer".

1.  - Click OK.

2.  Close and restart Bloom.

The new sources appear below Sources for New Books on the Collections [tab](../../User_Interface/Tabs/Tabs_overview.md).

#### Tip

- You can change the filename extension to \*.zip, if necessary. Then, the recipient can change it back to \*.BloomPack.
