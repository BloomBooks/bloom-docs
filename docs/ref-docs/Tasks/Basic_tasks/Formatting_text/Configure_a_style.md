## Configure a style

[Formatting Text overview](Formatting_Text_overview.md) informs you about [default fonts](../Select_front_matter_or_back_matter_from_a_pack.md) in the Book Making tab.

In a text box that uses the [style](../../../Concepts/Styles.md) you want to configure, click the gear icon (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/FontStarBare.png)) to open the Format dialog box. Be aware that your changes can affect other text boxes that use the same style even if the text boxes display different languages.

### Format dialog box with no tabs

-   If you do not see tabs, make choices described for the Characters tab below.
    

### Format dialog box with multiple tabs

1.  Style Name tab - [choose or create](Choose_or_create_a_style.md) a style.
    
2.  Characters tab - make any of these choices:
    

2.  -   Choose a font face that has a check mark (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/ValidFONT.png) - described below).
        
    -   Choose a font size.
        
    -   Choose a different numerical value that sets the spacing between lines of text.  
        For example, "2.0" means that the line is twice as high as the font.
        

2.  -   Choose Normal, Wide, or Extra Wide for the spacing between words.
        
    -   Choose one or more Emphasis: ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Edit_tasks/EmphasisButtons.png) (bold, italics or underlined).
        
    -   Click the Color control to [use](Choose_text_color_for_a_style.md) the Text Color [dialog box](../../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Text_Color_dialog_box.md).
        

3.  Paragraph tab - make any of these choices:
    
    -   Click one of the Indent options: ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/LeftIndent.png) (no indent) or ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/FirstLineIndent.png) (first line indent).
        

3.  -   Click one of the Alignment options: ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/LeftAlignment.png), ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/CenteredAlignment.png) or ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/RtAlign.png).
        
4.  -   Click the Space Between Paragraphs control, and then click a number.
        

0 means that no additional space will be added between paragraphs;

1 means that the space between paragraphs is the same as one line of texts.

4.  Highlighting tab - When audio is playing the text in an overlay (speech bubble, text box and so on) that text is highlighted with colors. You choose those colors used for the highlighting in this tab. These colors are used with the style you set in the Style Name tab.
    

-   Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedCheckboxBLUE.png)) Background color and then click the colored box to open and use the Background color dialog box.
    
-   Select (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/SelectedCheckboxBLUE.png)) Text color and then click the colored box to open and use the Text color dialog box.
    

5.  Overlay tab - click the down arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/DownArrowGray.png)) and then click a padding value to set the space between the text and its border.
    

-   In the Pages pane, click each page that uses the style to allow Bloom to apply the change to those pages.
    

6.  Click anywhere outside of the dialog box to close it.
    

#### Note

-   The Font control displays one of these symbols:
    

![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/GreenCheckMark.png) which means your font is legal to use for all Bloom purposes.

![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/YellowQuestionMark.png) which means that Bloom cannot determine the rules that govern the use of this font.

![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/RedExclamMark.png) which means that the font may not be embedded for free so you need to choose a different font.

-   Move your mouse over these symbols to see a box with information.
    

Except for a green check mark (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/GreenCheckMark.png)), the box also has an information button (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/GRAY_i.png)). Click it to see more details about the font.

These symbols also appear in the Book Making [tab](../Select_front_matter_or_back_matter_from_a_pack.md).

All the fonts you use are listed in the Book Settings [dialog box](../../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Book_Settings_dialog_box.md). 

-   The Background color and Text color dialog boxes are similar to the ones described in this Help topic: [Choose text or background colors](../../Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/Choose_text_or_background_colors.md).
    
-   Use the Text Box Properties dialog box to set text box language, vertical alignment and work with hint bubbles.
