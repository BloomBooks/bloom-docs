## Formatting Text overview

Here are formatting tasks you can do:

-   Format dialog box - [Configure a style](Configure_a_style.md) or [choose or create](Choose_or_create_a_style.md) one.
    
-   Settings dialog box - [Use the Book Making tab](../Select_front_matter_or_back_matter_from_a_pack.md) to choose the default [font](../../../Concepts/Font.md) for each language and the page numbering style.
    
-   Text Box Properties dialog box - [Set the properties](../../../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Text_Box_Properties_dialog_box.md) of [text boxes](../../../Concepts/Text_Box.md) (such as language, vertical alignment and hint bubbles).
    
-   You can also [apply direct formatting](Apply_direct_formatting.md) to selected characters or words.
    
-   You can usually do these steps to add an actionable hyperlink:
    
    -   Email: Right-click an actionable email address (underlined in blue), and then click copy email address. Paste it into Bloom.
        
    -   Internet URL: Copy the desired URL from your browser's address bar. Paste it into Bloom.
        

#### Tip

-   The list of styles that you see in the Style Name tab does not list all the styles used in the book.
    

For example, when you work with [inside pages](../../../Concepts/Inside_pages.md), you do not see styles used on the [Credits Page](../../../Concepts/Credits_Page.md) or [Tile Page](../../../Concepts/Title_Page.md).

-   Some languages use scripts that require a [greater line height](../Set_line_spacing_for_scripts_with_tall_characters.md) than the default settings.
