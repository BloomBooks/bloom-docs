## Collection

In Bloom, a collection is a group of [books](Book.md).

Essentially, each Bloom book is a little database of texts in various translations, ready to be displayed either in the prompting box, or in the text itself. An interesting implication of this design is that any local language book can become a shell book for other languages; the formats of a shell book and local language book are identical.

#### Important

- If you cannot find your book, use the [toolbar](../User_Interface/Toolbar/Collections_toolbar.md) to [open](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Open_a_collection.md) another collection.

- The Bloom folder is installed here:

Windows® - My Documents\\Bloom or Documents\\Bloom

Linux - /home/`<user name>`/ Bloom

- To find a particular book, in the Collections [tab](../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md), right-click a book (or a template or sample shell) and then click Show in File Explorer.
- To learn where a collection is, in the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/BloomIcon_red.gif) Open/Create Collections dialog box, hold your mouse pointer over the name of a collection. A tool-tip shows the path.

- [Team Collection](Team_Collection.md) is a way you can work together with other team members.
