## Choose Picture from Word or Choose Word from Picture Pages

In the Add Page dialog box, below Game Pages, you see interactive pages. Here are two of them:

-   Choose Word from Picture shows one picture and multiple words. The reader needs to tap the correct word.
    
-   Choose Picture from Word shows one word and multiple picture. The reader needs to tap the correct picture.
    

In both cases, you type instructions for the page in the top box. Then, you must enter the correct answer in the first box. Bloom will shuffle the answers.

[https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/release-notes-5-4/](https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/release-notes-5-4/ "https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/release-notes-5-4/") also discusses these pages.
