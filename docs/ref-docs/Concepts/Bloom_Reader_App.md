## Bloom Reader app

If you have the Bloom Reader app [installed](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Install_Bloom_Reader_app.md) on your Android device, you can [send](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Share_your_BloomPUB_file.md) Bloom books to that device. Then, you can read, watch or listen to your books there.

### About this app

-   App is short for application.
    
-   An Android device is a device, such as a phone, tablet PC or e-book reader that runs on the Android operating system.
    
-   You can also [save](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Share_your_BloomPUB_file.md) your book as a BloomPUB (\*.bloompub) file and share that file with others.
    
-   You can set up a BloomExternal folder on your device. Then the Show books on SD card option will appear. You might need to [get more help](../Overview/Get_More_Help.md).
    
-   Bloom Reader comes with the Andika font. So, the BloomPUB file will be smaller if your book uses only Andika.
    

If you use other fonts, they will be embedded in the book if Bloom can determine that it can legally embed them. Otherwise, the book will use Andika.

-   This app can use the [Quiz](QuizPage.md) page.
