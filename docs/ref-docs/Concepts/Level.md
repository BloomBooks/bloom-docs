## Level

A reader is a book that is used for reading exercises.

A level is a rating. It reflects the difficulty to do a task. Here the task is to read.

The level of a [reader](Leveled_Readers.md) is determined by various [criteria](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Leveled_Reader_Tool/About_Count_and_Length_criteria.md) like these:

-   How many words are in a sentence?
    
-   How many words are on a page?
    
-   How many words are in the book?
    
-   How many different (unique) words are in the book?
    

Bloom has some levels by default. You can [configure](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Leveled_Reader_Tool/Reader_Levels_tab.md) them differently or add more levels.

Each level has a Word counts display. You need to [review word count information](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Leveled_Reader_Tool/Review_Count_and_Length_information.md).
