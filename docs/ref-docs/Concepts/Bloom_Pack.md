## Bloom Pack

There are two kinds of Bloom Packs.

### Bloom Pack (basic)

- Make Bloom Pack of Shell Books

When you [make](../Tasks/Shell_book_tasks/Make_a_Bloom_Pack.md) one, here is what happens:

1.  - Bloom puts all the [shell books](Shell_book.md) in the collection into a zip file.
    - Bloom changes the file name from `<name>`.zip to `<name>`.BloomPack.

One person can [create shell books for others](../Tasks/Shell_book_tasks/Create_a_shell_book.md) and then [make](../Tasks/Shell_book_tasks/Make_a_Bloom_Pack.md) a Bloom Pack that other people can [get](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Get_shell_books_from_others.md). People who get these Bloom Packs can translate the book into other languages. However, the Template Pages page is not available for use, nor can the pages be reordered.

- Save as Bloom Pack (.BloomPack)

This command is available in any collection.

Use it to [save](../Tasks/Shell_book_tasks/Make_a_Bloom_Pack.md) one book in a .BloomPack file.

### Reader Template Bloom Pack

- Make Reader Template Bloom Pack

Use this command when you work with the Decodable Reader Tool or Leveled Reader Tool.

When you [make](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Make_Reader_Template_BloomPack.md) one, here is what happens:

1.  - Bloom does the same things as it does for a basic Bloom Pack but also puts the decodable reader settings, the leveled reader settings, and the current set of [sample words](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Decodable_Reader_Tool/Words_tab.md) in the file.
    - Files in the Sample Texts folder become .json files. See: [About word list and sample texts](About_word_lists_and_sample_texts.md).

One person can [set up](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Decodable_Reader_Tool/Set_up_Decodable_Reader_Tool_dialog_box.md) decodable readers or [set up](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Leveled_Reader_Tool/Set_up_Leveled_Reader_Tool_dialog_box.md) leveled readers and then [make](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Make_Reader_Template_BloomPack.md) a reader template Bloom Pack. Other people can [get](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Get_Reader_Template_Bloom_Pack_from_others.md) it. In this case, the people who get these Bloom Packs can use them like [templates](Template.md). You can add pages and reorder pages.

### Distribute a Bloom Pack file in any of these ways:

- Put it on a shared USB flash drive.
- Put it in a shared folder on a networked computer.
- Use Dropbox ([https://www.dropbox.com/](https://www.dropbox.com/ "https://www.dropbox.com/")).
- Send it with Skype (or similar), if it is not too big.
- Attach it to an e-mail, if it is not too big.

### Delete a Bloom Pack folder from your computer

- If you installed a Bloom Pack, the Collections [tab](../User_Interface/Tabs/Collections_tab_commands.md) can display a folder button (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/RemoveFolder.png)) near the name of the collection.

Click the button to find the collection folder you want to delete.

#### Note

- Bloom Pack files typically have this icon: ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/BloomPackIcon.png).
- Bloom [Subscription Codes](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Enter_Subscription_Code.md) are not included in Bloom Packs. So recipients of your Bloom Pack need to do the steps above before or after using the contents of your Bloom Pack.
- On the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Toolbar/HelpButtonBW.png) (Get Help) [menu](../User_Interface/Help_menu/Help_menu.md), click Building Reader Templates and Using Reader Templates. These documents describe these templates and how to use them.
