## eBook

eBook is one of the [templates](Template.md) that you can use to make a new book or shell book. The default page [size and orientation](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Choose_page_size_and_orientation.md) is Device 16x9 Landscape.  

It has these pages: [Front Cover](Front_Cover_page.md), [Credits Page](Credits_Page.md), [Title Page,](Title_Page.md) and [Back Cover pages](Back_cover_pages.md). In addition, it gives you a number of different templates. You see them when you [add a page](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Add_a_page.md).

You can [add a page](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Add_a_page.md) (an [inside page](Inside_pages.md)) to the book.

-   You can choose a page that puts a [picture](Picture.md) in the desired location on the page.
    
-   You can choose a page that is only for words or only for a picture.
    
-   You can [customize](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Using_the_Change_Layout_controls.md) any of the pages, or you can use the [Custom](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/About_the_Change_Layout_controls.md) page template to design your own page ([example](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Custom_page_template_example.md)).
