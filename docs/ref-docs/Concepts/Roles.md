## Roles

[Bloom](../Overview/Bloom_overview.md) supports roles. This means that people can have different tasks to do. Of course, each situation is different and anyone can author new books without any established set of roles. [https://vimeo.com/album/3146448/video/114043219](https://vimeo.com/album/3146448/video/114043219 "https://vimeo.com/album/3146448/video/114043219") is a [video](../FAQ/Instructional_Videos.md) that can help you understand possible roles.

Here are some possible roles and tasks. You might work in a group with fewer or more roles, or with different task assignments.
