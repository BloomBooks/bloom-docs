# Red font color/red line

When a [text box](Text_Box.md) is too full, we refer to it as an overflow. This is not the same as a text box with [too many words](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Leveled_Reader_Tool/Example_too_many_words.md) in a decodable reader.

A page that has an overflowing text box is flagged (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Concepts/OverflowFLAG.png)) in the Pages pane. On that page, you will see either a red font and border, or a red line.

-   For most pages, a red font and red border color indicates a text box overflow.
    

To solve this, you can [resize the text box](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/About_the_Change_Layout_controls.md) or reduce the number of words in it, or [change formatting](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/Formatting_Text_overview.md).

Here is an example:

-   For a [custom](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Custom_page_template_example.md) or [customized](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Using_the_Change_Layout_controls.md) inside page, a red line indicates a text box overflow.
    

To solve this, you can [resize the text box](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/About_the_Change_Layout_controls.md) or reduce the number of words in it, or [change formatting](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/Formatting_Text_overview.md).
