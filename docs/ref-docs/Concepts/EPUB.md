## ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/EPUB_buttonSmall.png) ePUB

ePUB is short for _electronic publication._ In Bloom, ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/Publish_tasks/EPUB_buttonSmall.png) ePUB is one of the [digital publishing options](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Digital_publishing_options.md). You can use it to [save](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Save_EPUB_file.md) your book to an \*.epub file.

The Bloom Accessibility Checker and Book Metadata dialog boxes are [accessibility](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Accessibility.md) features you use with ePUBs.

These \*.epub files can be downloaded and read in a wide variety of electronic smart devices, such as smartphones, tablets and computers that have (or are) an [ePUB Reader](Epub_Readers.md). Consequently, we cannot predict how your book might appear in every device.

### ePUB mode

The ePUB mode chooser is in the Publish [tab](../Tasks/Publish_tasks/Publish_tasks_overview.md). It has two options: 

-   Fixed asks ePUB [readers](Epub_Readers.md) to show pages exactly like you see them in Bloom. This mode requires ePUB readers that support ePUB 3 format.
    
-   Flowable allows ePUB reader apps to lay out images and text however they want.
    

Pro: With this mode, the ePUB reader app might allow the person reading the book to increase the font size.

Pro: This mode will work with ePUB readers that do not support ePUB 3.

Con: Any custom pages will not look good.

Con: This mode is not available if your book has [overlay](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/Overlay_Tool_overview.md) pages (e.g. comics).

See [https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/ePUB-notes](https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/ePUB-notes "https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/ePUB-notes") to learn more about the performance of these ePUB modes and readers.

#### Note

-   You can usually do these steps to add an actionable hyperlink:
    

Email: Right-click an actionable email address (underlined in blue), and then click copy email address. Paste it into Bloom.

Internet URL: Copy the desired URL from your browser's address bar. Paste it into Bloom.

-   Fonts:
    
-   -   Fonts are embedded if they indicate that they can be embedded.  
        Exceptions: Bold and italic font variants are not embedded even if they are used in the text.
        
    -   Fonts are excluded if they indicate that they cannot be embedded. But, there is no warning if a font is excluded.  
        If a font indicates that it cannot be embedded, but you have permission to embed it, there are no controls that permit you to override Bloom's decision to exclude it.
