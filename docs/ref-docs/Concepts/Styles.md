## Styles

A style is a named definition of how your text should appear. Each style has a set of selections for the [font](Font.md) face, font size, line and word spacing, and so on.

Consider, for example, a text box on an [inside page](Inside_pages.md) that holds words in the local language. It uses a different style than a text box that holds the book title ([cover page](Front_Cover_page.md)) in a national language. Text boxes that hold acknowledgements in the original language use another style, and so on.

The name of the current style is shown in the Format dialog box.

The extent to which you can change styles depends on the particular book:

-   When you make a new book from an [empty template](Template.md), you have an original book.
    

In this case, the Format dialog box has [tabs](../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Format_dialog_box.md). Then, you can [create](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/Choose_or_create_a_style.md) styles and [configure](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/Configure_a_style.md) them.

-   If you make a book from an existing book or shell, you do not have an original book.
    

In this case, the Format dialog box does not have tabs. You only see controls that match the Characters [tab](../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Format_dialog_box.md). You can only change the font face, font size, and line and word spacing for the current style.  
You might need to do this if you see a [red font color](Red_font_color.md) or a red line in a two or three language book. Otherwise, you would use the styles as they were set in the original book.

#### Important

-   The default [font face](Font.md) for each language is set in the Settings dialog box. Each [text box](Text_Box.md) uses a particular language. You see the default font in the Format dialog box. Then, if you change the font face, you override the default font for text boxes that use that language and style.
    
-   New styles you [create](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/Choose_or_create_a_style.md) or [configuration](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/Configure_a_style.md) changes you make to existing styles apply only to the book what was open when you did it.
    

Therefore, if you create a new style or change a standard style in particular book, you will not see that style or change in other books. If you use [Copy a page/Paste a page](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Copy_and_paste_a_page.md) the styles are copied to the other book.

-   Some styles that come with Bloom have spaces between words. Style names you [add](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Formatting_text/Choose_or_create_a_style.md) cannot contain spaces or any other characters that are not alphabetical.
    
-   The Text Box Properties dialog box also helps you specify how the words and sentences appear.
    
-   Styles may or may not be obeyed by some [electronic devices](EPUB.md).
