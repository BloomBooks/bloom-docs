## Acknowledgments

If a person or an organization helped in any way, it must be made known. That is, it must be acknowledged. The help may be direct or indirect. Your statement can include a dedication.

For many books, you can type (write about) acknowledgements in text boxes. Each text box has a [Bloom callout box](Callout_box.md) that describes its purpose and usually the language that the text box is set to use.

Here is a general overview:

-   On the [Title Page](Title_Page.md), below the text boxes for the book titles, there are two text boxes that use [language 2](../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Languages_tab.md).  
    You can acknowledge the [contributions](Contributions.md) of writers, illustrators, editors and any other people, and any funding agencies that helped pay for the book.
    
-   On the [Credits Page](Credits_Page.md), below the copyright and license information, there are two text boxes that use [language 2](../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Languages_tab.md).  
    You can type the name of the translator of the book and any additional acknowledgements.
