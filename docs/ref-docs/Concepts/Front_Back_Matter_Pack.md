## Front/Back Matter Pack

In the Book Making tab (Settings dialog box), you can use the Front/Back Matter Pack control to [choose](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Select_front_matter_or_back_matter_from_a_pack.md) a pack.

When you click a pack that was installed with Bloom, a brief explanation appears. It describes the purpose of the pack.

#### Note

-   If your organization requires a custom Front/Back Matter Pack, SIL can provide that to you through our [Bloom Enterprise](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Enterprise/EnterpriseRequired.md)Â service.
