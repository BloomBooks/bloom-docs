## Arithmetic Template

Arithmetic Template is one of the [templates](Template.md) you can use as a [source for new books](Sources_For_New_Books.md) or as a [source for new shells](Sources_For_New_Shells.md).

You use this template to make mathematics workbooks that have equations for users to solve.

-   The [inside pages](Inside_pages.md) have [text boxes](Text_Box.md) so you can type a page title, and also:
    
-   -   numbers
        
    -   mathematical operators, such as +, \-, x or รท.
        

Each equation has an equal sign (\=) next to the box where the user will write the solution. You cannot type in the solution box.

-   Two [picture placeholders](Picture.md) are associated with each equation.
    

#### Important

-   A5 Portrait is the only [page size and orientation](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Choose_page_size_and_orientation.md) available for this template.
    
-   รท (U+00F7 Division Sign) can be entered in two ways:
    
-   -   Press and hold the / key to see it on the [special characters panel](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Using_the_Special_Characters_panel.md).
        
    -   Press the Alt key, and type 0247 on your keypad.
