## Paper Comic Book Template

Paper Comic Book is one of the [templates](Template.md) you can use when you [use](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/Using_the_Overlay_Tool.md) the Overlay Tool.

When you [add a page](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Add_a_page.md) based on this template, there are two Paper Comic Book pages you can use. One is a full page image with no margin. The other is a full page image with no margin but with a text footer over the image.

You put the words for the page in speech bubbles, text blocks or captions. You can move them around on the image.

#### Note

-   Images are sized to fill the page vertically, so your image can appear to have the sides cropped.
    
-   The front cover page has a black background. As a result, you will not see pictures or lettering that are also black, such as images from the [Art of Reading](../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Image_Toolbox.md).
    
-   [Overlays](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Overlay_Tool/Overlay_Tool_overview.md) are not supported in [ePUB](EPUB.md).
