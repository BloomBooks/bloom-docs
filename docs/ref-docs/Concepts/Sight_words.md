## Sight words

Sight words are commonly used words. As such, they should be memorized by sight. Then, the person who is learning to read can automatically recognize them. No strategy to decode them is needed.

#### Sight words in Bloom

-   You type or paste sight words that you want to introduce in each stage in the Decodable Stages [tab](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Decodable_Reader_Tool/Decodable_Stages_tab.md).
    

Separate the words with spaces.

-   In the Decodable Stages tab, sight words appear as [matching words](Matching_words.md).
    
-   Sight words are cumulative.
    

That is, sight words from previous stages are collected in the list of [matching words](Matching_words.md).

-   Sight words have a wavy green underline in the list below Words in this stage (in the Decodable Reader Tool).
