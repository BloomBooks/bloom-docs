## Wall Calendar

In a Local Language [collection](Collection.md), you can use the Wall Calendar [template](Template.md) to make calendars.

You choose the year, and Bloom automatically puts dates on the correct days for each month. The [Setup dialog box](../User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Setup_dialog_box.md) allows you to type the day abbreviations and month names in your local language.

You can add pictures and short texts on the [Front Cover](Front_Cover_page.md), [Credits](Credits_Page.md) and [Title](Title_Page.md) pages. You can also add a picture with text for each month, and also type a brief line on any day of the week to identify holidays or events.

The [Back Cover pages](Back_cover_pages.md) can contain textual information about the calendar.
