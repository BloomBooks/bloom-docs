## Inside pages

Inside pages are between the [Front Cover](Front_Cover_page.md) and [Back Cover](Back_cover_pages.md) pages.

They are mainly the book manuscript pages that you can [add](../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Add_a_page.md) and have page numbers. But the [Title Page](Title_Page.md) and [Credits Page](Credits_Page.md) are also considered inside pages because they are inside of the cover pages.

-   The Pages pane in the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/EditTab.png)Edit tab distinguishes the cover pages from the inside pages with different colors.
    
-   The ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/PublishTab.png) Publish tab distinguishes the cover pages from the inside pages so you have the option of printing the cover pages and inside pages on different paper.
    

#### Note

-   Page numbers in the published book appear after the Credits Page.
    

You can [choose](../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Select_front_matter_or_back_matter_from_a_pack.md) the page number style.
