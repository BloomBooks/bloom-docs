## Collections tab commands

Do any of these steps in the left pane of the ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/Collections.png) Collections [tab](Tabs_overview.md).

- Above the collection name, you see a statement with the number of books in the current collection and goal.

Click it and then click View on BloomLibrary.org to open the collection there.

### Collection Name ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/WhiteDownArrow.png)

- Click the down arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Tabs/WhiteDownArrow.png)) near the collection name to see these commands:

  - Open or Create Another Collection - See: [Create a Bloom collection](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Create_a_Bloom_collection.md).
  - Make Bloom Pack of Shell Books - See: [Make a Bloom Pack](../../Tasks/Shell_book_tasks/Make_a_Bloom_Pack.md).
  - Make Reader Template Bloom Pack - See: [Make a Reader Template Bloom Pack](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Make_Reader_Template_BloomPack.md).
  - Troubleshooting:
  - - Do Checks of All Books: It checks all the books in the collection. A pop-up window shows any problem identified. If you see problems, run Do Updates of All Books. If there are still problems, [get more help](../../Overview/Get_More_Help.md).
    - Do Updates of All Books: It updates all of the books to use the most-recent front/back matter. It compresses all of the pictures and updates the picture metadata.
    - Rescue Missing Images: It opens the Browse For Folder dialog box. Use it find pictures to replace any that are missing.

### Thumbnail for a book, template or sample shell

1.  - Right-click (or click) a book [thumbnail](../../Concepts/Thumbnail.md) to see the down arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Book%20Down%20Arrow.png)), and then click it to see some or all of these commands:
    - Rename Book: See [Rename a book thumbnail](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Rename_a_book_thumbnail.md). You can rename the book thumbnail and book folder without changing the book [title](../../Concepts/Book_Title.md).
    - Duplicate Book: It allows you to [duplicate](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Duplicate_a_book.md) that book.
    - Show in File Explorer: It opens the folder on your hard drive that stores the book. You would do this, for example, to manually [delete](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Delete_or_rename_a_collection.md) a collection or [edit](../../Tasks/Advanced_tasks/Editing_stylesheets.md) a stylesheet.
    - ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Delete.png) Delete Book: It [deletes](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Delete_a_book.md) the [book](../../Concepts/Book.md).
    - More ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/LeftArrow.png)

      - Export to Word or LibreOffice: It opens the HTML document in Microsoft® Word or LibreOffice. The layout is lost, but there may be reasons you would want to export a book. Printing a draft or to check spellings could be reasons.
      - Export to Spreadsheet ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/BloomEnterprise%20button.png) : It [exports](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Export_to_Spreadsheet.md) a file with the file type \*.xlsx.

This is a [Bloom Enterprise](../../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Enterprise/EnterpriseRequired.md) feature. The Export to Spreadsheet [dialog box](../Dialog_boxes/Export_to_Spreadsheet_dialog_box.md) lists limitations.

- Import Content from Spreadsheet ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/BloomEnterprise%20button.png) : It [imports](../../Tasks/Basic_tasks/Import_Content_from_Spreadsheet.md) contents from an \*.xlsx spreadsheet that was previously exported.

This is a [Bloom Enterprise](../../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Enterprise/EnterpriseRequired.md) feature.

- Save as Single File (.bloomSource): It updates the book and the book folder is saved in a zip file, renamed as `<name>`.bloom (instead of .zip). Some files are excluded in this zip file, such as files ending in .pdf, .bloombookorder, .map, and .bloompack. You can choose where to save the file.
- Save as Bloom Pack (.BloomPack): It makes a [Bloom pack](../../Concepts/Bloom_Pack.md).
- Update Thumbnail: It updates the picture in the book's icon.
- Update Book: It updates the front matter and back matter. It also compresses the pictures and updates their metadata.
