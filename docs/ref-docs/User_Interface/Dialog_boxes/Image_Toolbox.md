## Image Toolbox

When you [change a picture](../../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Change_picture.md) ([image](../../Concepts/Picture.md)), you can use the Image Toolbox.

### Get Picture ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/getpicture.png)

-   Click the source: ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/artofreading.png) Art of Reading, ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/scanner.png) Scanner, ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/camera.png) Camera or ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/Tasks/File.png) File.
    
-   1.  For Art of Reading, do either of these steps:
        
    
    1.  -   If [Art Of Reading](https://bloomlibrary.org/artofreading "https://bloomlibrary.org/artofreading") version 3.1 (or later) is installed and you have the appropriate keyboard, you can type a word in the Search the Art of Reading Gallery box in other languages. Click the down-arrow (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/DownArrow.png)) that is next to the search box, and then click the desired language. Type the word that describes the picture you want to find.
            
        -   For older versions of Art of Reading, in the search box, type an English wordÂ that describes the picture you want to find.
            
    
    2.  Click the search button (![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/SearchButton.png)).
        
    3.  Click the picture you want to use. Click OK.
        
-   For Scanner, Camera or File, do the necessary steps to find the picture.
    

### Crop ![](/ref-docs-assets/images/User_Interface/Dialog_boxes/Crop.png)

-   [Crop a picture](../../Tasks/Edit_tasks/Crop_a_picture.md).
    

### Metadata

-   Click the link that appears, either Set up metadata or Edit.
    
-   -   Then [use](Copyright_License_dialog_box_Images.md) the Copyright and License dialog box.
        

Other links may appear. Some open Internet sites if you have an Internet connection.

#### Tip

-   Normally, when you select an existing image to use in Bloom and set metadata on it, the metadata is automatically saved in the original image so it will be available if you use that image again.
    

If the program is unable to modify the file (CD, directory or drive for which you do not have write permission, and so on), it will appear to work normally, but the metadata will not be there the next time you select that image.
