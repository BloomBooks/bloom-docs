## BloomPUB Books {#703db164da8a4d57ba0661fadbd88f95}


Bloom Reader requires books in BloomPUB format (Bloom’s “native” format). Bloom Editor can easily produce BloomPUB files to use with Bloom Reader.


To learn about the difference between BloomPUB and ePUB formats, see [BloomPUB vs. ePUB: What’s the Difference](/compare-bloomPUB-ePUB).
