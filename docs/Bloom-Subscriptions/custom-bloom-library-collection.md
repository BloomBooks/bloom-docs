A **Bloom Library Collection** is a curated set of books grouped under a custom bookshelf. Organizations can create their own collections to:

- Introduce their organization to new users
- Highlight work in specific languages or regions
- Group books by theme, audience, or program

Collections make it easier for readers to discover related content and for teams to manage public visibility.


## Introduce Your Organization {#2164bb19df1280bab798eaa97c52f7a0}


At the top of the web page for your collection, you have the opportunity to provide a brief introduction to your organizationâ€™s work. This should include your logo and a brief paragraph about your work.
