## Team Collections {#21e4bb19df1280d59b78f6c680be7fec}


Team Collections enable a team to collaborate on a single collection of books. Team members check books in and out as they work on them, and use the Dropbox file-sharing service to synchronize files between their computers.


See  [Team Collections : Introduction](/team-collections-intro) to learn more.


## Overlay Tool {#c420f5ea3d97478998101e3c5b79aa8c}


The **Overlay Tool** allows the user to place text, images, or video over a partial or full-page image. This allows more complex page layouts, including Digital and Paper Comic Book Templates.
