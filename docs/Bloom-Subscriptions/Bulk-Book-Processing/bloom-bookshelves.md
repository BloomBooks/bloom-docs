## Overview {#df0855b964e24b7394027fff9c54cea3}


Organizations holding a Bloom Enterprise subscription can organize their books into different bookshelves (book collections). For example, below is a sampling of the Bloom Library bookshelves for the organization **Education for Life**:

Bloom provides two different bulk operations to its Enterprise clients: 

1. Bulk uploading an entire collection of books to **Bloom Library**, and
2. Making BloomPUBs for an entire collection for distribution to the **Bloom Reader** app.

Both bulk operations depend on grouping books into particular “bookshelves” similar to those shown above for Education for Life.


### Essential Steps for Setup {#129a30f7be7b45e59c5b7e6be3b3ae75}


There are two essential steps before initiating either of these bulk processing operations.

1. Set the [Bloom Library Bookshelf](/bloom-bookshelves#8874d41827394c69a5ef00d4508fda2a) for the book collection to set the bookshelf.
2. Ensure the [publishing settings](/bloom-bookshelves#0ef8e2f1272c4ea88040940a6cdcce56) for each book are correct.

**Set Bloom Library Bookshelf**


Here are the steps to select the **Bloom Library Bookshelf**:


![](./bloom-bookshelves.5e121b7d-814d-4834-9931-4a9d7d25d42b.png)

1. Choose the `Book Making` tab of Bloom Editor Settings.
2. Select the **bookshelf** from the `Bloom Library Bookshelf` drop-down.
3. Click `OK`.

Setting up bookshelves is something done in coordination with the Bloom Librarian.

**Check Publishing Settings**


Once the **Bloom Library Bookshelf** has been selected for the collection of books, the second essential step is to carefully set the publishing settings for _each_ individual book in the collection. 

1. Click on the `Publish` tab.
	1. Click the `Web` option:

2. For **each** book, ensure the following are correct:
	- Book **Copyright**.
	- Book **Summary**.
	- Selection of **Text Languages**.
	- Selection of **Talking Book Languages**.
	- Selection of book **Features** (for example: `Talking Book`, `Sign Language`, `Motion Book`, etc)
	- **Cover Color**
	- **Visibility**

## Bulk Uploading to Web {#9db147e9949e425cb73cb3b013f07c55}


After completing the two essential steps, the entire collection can be bulk uploaded. 


Choose any book, and go to Publish to Web.


There are three options for uploading:

1. Upload a single Book.
2. Upload an entire collection of books.
3. Upload a folder containing multiple collections.

The third option is rarely used and will not be discussed further in this article. To access bulk uploading of a single collection, click the arrow beside **UPLOAD BOOK** and choose **Upload this Collection**.

After making this selection, click the button to initiate the operation:

The bulk-uploader program will open in a separate window and begin its operation. 


There are a number of very important things to keep in mind about the bulk-uploader program. This bulk-uploader program will :

- Upload all new books (i.e. any book that had not been previously uploaded to Bloom Library).
- Upload (and overwrite) any previously uploaded book that has changed.
- Skip uploading any previously uploaded book that has _not_ changed.
