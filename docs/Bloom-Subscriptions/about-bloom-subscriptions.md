# About Bloom Subscriptions {#0c41c9c9b95e4681acc645d60786abf9}


Bloom is free to use for many kinds of projects. But some advanced features, especially those designed for large teams or special publishing needs, require a paid subscription. 


A Bloom Subscription will unlock extra features in Bloom Editor and Bloom Library. These features help individuals and organizations do more with Bloom, like managing large collections of books, creating custom-branded materials, or using special tools for advanced publishing.


## For Publishers {#1749741a68ac444a81233742289b2797}


Bloom helps publishers create high-quality books in multiple languages and formats. With Bloom Enterprise, your team can manage large collections, use templates that match your branding, and organize your books on custom Bloom Library bookshelves. You also get access to analytics to track book downloads and engagement. Whether you're publishing educational materials, storybooks, or translated texts, Bloom makes it faster and easier to produce and share books in any language.


## For Language Projects {#899e4b96f09644c0b90f5142c0c11f7f}


Language development and literacy projects often need to create and translate many books. Bloom gives your team the tools to do this efficiently. Subscriptions like Bloom Pro and Bloom Enterprise unlock features like spreadsheet-based book creation and team collections. These make it easier to involve local contributors and scale your work. Bloom supports any writing system and even works offline, making it ideal for use in remote or multilingual settings.


## For Local Communities {#ece17bfb46064df98f907753e7ee262a}


Bloom is designed to be easy to use even if youâ€™re new to computers. Many features are free to help communities write, translate, and share books in their own languages. If your project is fully funded and managed by your local language community, you qualify for a free license to access even more features. Bloom helps your community tell its own stories, create books for children, and preserve local knowledge in written form.
