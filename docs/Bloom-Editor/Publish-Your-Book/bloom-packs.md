## What is a Bloom Pack? {#46e47900e0d0471f9ac9e86f7f1bb628}


A Bloom Pack is a file used to share book templates and settings with others. There are two types of Bloom Packs:

- [Basic Bloom Pack](/bloom-packs#506ac2364bea42d6aa93ef983ea51765)
- [Reader Template Bloom Pack](/bloom-packs#e75ebe7d9b87401490e1da579907131a)

### 1. Basic Bloom Pack {#506ac2364bea42d6aa93ef983ea51765}


A Basic Bloom Pack contains shell books (template books) that others can translate into different languages. Shell books are templates used to create other books. It sets the page layout, text box locations, pictures, and more. Shell books are not language-specific, meaning they can be used to create books in any language.
