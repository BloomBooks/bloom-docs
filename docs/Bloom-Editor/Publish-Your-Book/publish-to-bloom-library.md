## Updating a book on Bloom Library {#5b078502785c4a3092b3025f3316a69d}


If Bloom Library already has a book with the same ID number, you must specify whether the book you are uploading is an update to the existing book, or a different book. 

- Choose **Yes, I want to update this book** if your book is a new version of the book that is already in Bloom Library. Your new book will replace the older version.
- Choose **No, these are different books** if you are uploading a different book. Bloom will assign a new ID number to your book and add it to the library. The older book will remain in the library.
