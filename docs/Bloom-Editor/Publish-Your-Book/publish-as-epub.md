Creating an ePUB version of your book allows it to be read on various electronic devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers. This flexibility helps you reach a wider audience and ensures that your content can be accessed anytime, anywhere. ePUB files are compatible with a range of ePUB readers, allowing for a more personalized reading experience. Depending on the device and reader, users can adjust text size, layout, and even enjoy added features like recorded audio.

The ePUB format is widely used, but many ePUB reader applications are of low quality, and some Bloom features are not supported by ePUB readers. You may want to consider whether you can distribute your book in the BloomPUB format instead of, or in addition to, the ePUB format. See [BloomPUB vs. ePUB: Whatâ€™s the Difference](/compare-bloomPUB-ePUB) for more details.
