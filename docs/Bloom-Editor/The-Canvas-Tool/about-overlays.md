## The Canvas Tool {#6f0339d040694d8a9ff23cc303f05e68}


The **Canvas Tool** lets you place speech bubbles, captions, text, images, and Sign Language videos on top of a background image. In addition, you can add navigation buttons that link to specific pages in your book or jump to other books in your book collection.

The **Canvas Tool** is an advanced feature offered to users possessing a **Bloom Subscription.** To create new books with the Canvas Tool, you must be a Bloom Enterprise subscriber or use Bloom Enterprise under Bloom’s community funding guidelines. 



If you are not a Bloom Enterprise user, you can still read Bloom Books that were created with the Canvas Tool. You can also develop translations of Bloom books that feature Canvas elements.



See [[About Bloom Subscriptions](/about-bloom-subscriptions)] for more information.
