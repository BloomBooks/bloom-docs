Printing a book is a two-step process in Bloom:

1. First, you use Bloom to create a **PDF** version of your book.

	:::note
	
	A **PDF file** is a computer file that looks like a printed document, with text and graphics.
	
	:::
	
	

2. Then you print and share your book with others.

## Choose a Page Size and Orientation {#b434d49e12b94563ac526dc97b40fb6d}


To get your book ready to print:

1. **Open (Edit)** the book you want to print.
2. Select a **page size** and **orientation** from the toolbar.

	:::note
	
	Choose a paper size that your printer supports. (In this example, we have chosen **A5Portrait**.
