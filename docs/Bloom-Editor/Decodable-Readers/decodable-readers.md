A **Decodable Reader** is a special kind of leveled reader. A decodable reader is carefully written so that it uses only the letters a student has already learned. Decodable readers are designed to fit what a new reader has learned and is ready to read.


# Decodable Stages {#b8a7ff8e058543e18632627c9c8ab974}


A language may have a few **decodable stages** (5-10) or many decodable stages (30 or more). The number of stages is based on how children are taught to read in that language.


Each stage introduces one or more letters and may introduce some **sight words** as well. **Sight words** are words that have been selected for students to learn even though they may use letters that haven't been taught yet.


When you make a decodable book, Bloom helps you make sure that your book is decodable at that stage. It does that by giving you visual feedback when you type a word that is not decodable at that stage. 


## An example of a decodable stage {#c15bc3268b0f49b49dadae2d14664d15}


In the example shown here, there are 5 stages. Each stage introduces a number of letters.  For each stage, the words used in the decodable book should only have the letters that have already been introduced. If the book includes a letter that has not yet been taught, Bloom will highlight the words.


The one exception involves **sight words**. Bloom will not highlight a sight word that has already been introduced.


In this case the **sight words** are **Dick and Jane**. They may have been included so that a story can be written using their names before all their letters have been taught.

# Using a Decodable Book template to create a decodable book {#86566c716e0d4378a500b2d2bcbd0ab0}


In the **Collections Tab**, in the **Sources for New Books**, scroll down until you find the **Reader Templates** that someone has given you.


In this example, there is a set of templates, one for each decodable stage.


Select a template that corresponds to the decodable stage for your book. In this example, if we want to write a Stage 2 Decodable Reader we select the corresponding template, then click **Make a book using this source**. The book is added to my collection and is opened for editing.
