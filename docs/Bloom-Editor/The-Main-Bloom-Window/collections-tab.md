Bloom comes with many different kinds of book templates. You can use these to create different kinds of books easily.


For more information, see [Bloomâ€™s Built-in Book Templates](/built-in-templates).


### Sample Shell Books {#c95bd7673fe34857aed83401d94ad830}


Bloom also comes with a few **sample shell books**. These books are **ready-to-translate**: they already have a full story, complete with pictures and text, which makes it easy to publish in a local language.
