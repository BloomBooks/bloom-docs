![](./collections-tab.fcb0d176-8243-4130-8580-69fbd9474bba.png)


There are many different types of books to choose from:

- [Book Templates](/collections-tab#88adc23237dc4615bb06b26992ef2131)
- [Sample Shell Books](/collections-tab#c95bd7673fe34857aed83401d94ad830)

### Templates {#88adc23237dc4615bb06b26992ef2131}


Bloom comes with many different kinds of book templates.


![](./collections-tab.a541b3a9-cb8c-44d5-a85d-609ac34cc48c.png)


You can use these to easily create **different kinds** of books:

- **Basic Books:** These are simpler books with a variety of text and pictures.
- **Big Books:** These are especially helpful for classroom settings, because they have big text and big pictures.
- **Decodable/Levels Readers:** These help early readers learn to read.
- **Comic Books:** Colorful full-page books, with different types of text options (including comic book style speech bubbles).
- **Sign Language Books:** Books with text and sign language videos together!
- And more!

### Sample Shell Books {#c95bd7673fe34857aed83401d94ad830}


Bloom also comes with a few **sample shell books**. These books are **ready-to-translate**: they already have a full story, complete with pictures and text, which makes it easy to publish in a local language.
