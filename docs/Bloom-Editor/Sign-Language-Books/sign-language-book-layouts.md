There are multiple ways to use sign language videos in Bloom books.


## Video Only {#9cde15a15933402eb9a2b4cf13f2d1a1}


Some pages can have just a video:


<ReactPlayer controls url={video1} />


## Sign Language Talking Books {#e5a8427d4fac4ab7a416614664d88fc2}


You can also make **Sign Language Talking Books** that can be enjoyed by both hearing and deaf members of a family.


These can be relatively simple books:


	<ReactPlayer controls url={video2} />


Or more complex stories:


<ReactPlayer controls url={video3} />


## Video with Audio {#1e6308c7e45b4c4a9774c8fca0848589}


Videos can also **include audio**, with or without written text:


<ReactPlayer controls url={video4} />


## Transparent Video {#1b48fc0a5a5e4944b0904ce3be0c8f87}
