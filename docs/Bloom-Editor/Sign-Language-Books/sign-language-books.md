People who are Deaf* communicate using sign language. Video is one medium that is commonly used for recording sign language communication. Bloom’s Sign Language book template has a placeholder to add sign language video. A page can contain only a sign language video or a sign language video combined with images, text, and/or audio.


:::tip

When “deaf” is spelled with a lower case “d”, it refers to the fact that someone cannot hear. When it is spelled with a capital “D”, it refers to Deaf culture and community. In this module we are referring to those who identify themselves as Deaf and communicate using sign language.
