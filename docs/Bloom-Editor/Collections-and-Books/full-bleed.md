The above image taken from the children’s book “Where the Wild Things Are” shows an edge-to-edge image. To achieve that edge-to-edge finished product for your printed book, you must give the print shop must receive a “full bleed” PDF. In a full-bleed PDF, the page size is slightly larger than the actual page size of the printed book. In this way, there is an allowance for the print shop to trim the paper and still get a nice clean edge for all of the pages.


:::caution

For books which do not require edge-to-edge images, there is little need for full-bleed printing.

## Paper Comic Book {#30b4bb19df1280e1a0b5e67182d0d0ef}


In Bloom 6.3, there is only one book template which is designed for full-bleed printing for the entire book (front cover _and_ interior pages). This is the **Paper Comic Book** template.

This book template provides an automatic full-bleed the front cover, and it provides two edge-to-edge full-bleed interior pages:

## Other Paper Sizes with full-bleed {#30b4bb19df1280c5ac22d8b2d766f926}


Bloom allows for full-bleed printing for a number of other paper sizes, such as A5. 


However, currently Bloom does _not_ provide an interior page template which allows edge-to-edge, full page images with no margin. Only the Paper Comic Book provides such a template. 


However, Bloom does provide a means to have a full-bleed image for the front cover. For further detail, see Book Settings. 


:::caution

Note: in a future version of Bloom, we plan to provide page templates for edge-to-edge interior pages for non-comic print page sizes.
