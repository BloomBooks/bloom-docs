Bloom gives you multiple ways to add images to your books.


Bloom has a unique design to show where you can add an image. Whenever you see a **placeholder** with an image of a flower, you can insert an image.

:::note

The placeholder image is never printed in the published form of a book. If you do not replace the placeholder flower with another image, the published book will have a blank space there.

1. **Image Galleries** are searchable collections of images in a special format that Bloom understands. You can [install the free Art of Reading collection](/install-art-of-reading) from SIL International, or you may have another image collection available to you.
2. A **scanner** directly attached to your computer.
3. A **digital camera** directly attached to your computer.
4. A **file** in your computer‚Äôs file system.

We will focus on the **Image Galleries** and **File** methods below. 


## Add an Image From an Image Gallery {#de4d254b555a4c378a635319b1973cc1}


In this section, we will show how to add an image from the free **Art of Reading** image gallery from SIL International. (If you do not have the Art of Reading installed, you can find instructions on how to install it in [Install Art of Reading](/install-art-of-reading).)

1. In the _Image Toolbox_, click on the **`Image Galleries`** tab.
2. Type a **keyword** into the search box.

	:::note
	
	The **Art of Reading** images are searchable in **English, Arabic, Bislama, Chinese, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, and Thai**.
	
	Search terms can be in any of the languages listed above.
	
	:::
	
	

3. To change the language you are using to search, click the **drop-down arrow next to the name of the search language**. For instance, if your search term is **‚Äúcat‚Äù**, the search term language should be **‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù**.
4. Click the **search icon** **üîé** (or press the **Enter** key). Bloom will show you all the images that have been tagged with that keyword.
5. **Select an image** from the results returned.
6. Click **`OK`** to insert the image into your book.

<div class='notion-row'>
<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>


Bloom automatically changes the size of the image so that it fills up the box where the image has been placed.
