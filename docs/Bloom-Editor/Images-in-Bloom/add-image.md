Bloom encourages you to include pictures in your books by including a **flower placeholder** in many of the page templates.

When editing a page in a book, if you see the **flower placeholder**, this is where you can insert an image.


:::note

The placeholder image is never printed in the published form of a book. If you do not replace the placeholder flower with another image, the published book will have a blank space there.

## Paste from Clipboard {#29b4bb19df1280d8bfc1d19da7008fef}


If you are familiar with using Windows Explorer, this is the easiest method. 


First, **copy** the image onto the Windows clipboard:

1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the folder where your images are located.
2. Select an image from the folder.
3. Click the **`Copy`** command icon (alternatively, type the keyboard shortcut **`CTRL C`**).

(Alternatively, you could copy the image from any other program, such as a photo editor.)


After copying the image, **paste** it into Bloom:

1. Select the flower placeholder where you wish to paste your image.
2. Click on the Paste Image button.

## Using the Image Toolbox {#848d5a8d84334d7a9fa320482f84b876}


Suppose you are unfamiliar with using Windows Explorer. In that case, you can use Bloom's built-in file explorer to add images, or you can add pictures from an installed Image Gallery such as [Art of Reading](/install-art-of-reading).


To access the Image Toolbox:

1. Hover your mouse over the flower placeholder.
2. Click the **Change Image** button that appears.

:::note

You can open the Image Toolbox by clicking the **Change Image** button even if you have already replaced the placeholder with an image.

The Image Toolbox gives you two methods for inserting images:


![](./add-image.29b4bb19-df12-80ed-a111-ddb7c1f43771.png)

1. **Image Galleries** are searchable collections of images in a special format that Bloom understands. You can [install the free Art of Reading collection](/install-art-of-reading) from SIL International, or you may have another image collection available to you.
2. A **file** in your computer’s file system.

### Add an Image From an Image Gallery {#de4d254b555a4c378a635319b1973cc1}


In this section, we will show how to add an image from the free **Art of Reading** image gallery from SIL International. (If you do not have the Art of Reading installed, you can find instructions on how to install it in [Install Art of Reading](/install-art-of-reading).)

1. In the `Image Toolbox`, click on the `Image Galleries` tab.
2. Type a **keyword** into the search box.

	:::note
	
	The **Art of Reading** images are searchable in **English, Arabic, Bislama, Chinese, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, and Thai**.
	
	Search terms can be in any of the languages listed above.
	
	:::
	
	

3. To change the language you are using to search, click the **drop-down arrow next to the name of the search language**. For instance, if your search term is **“cat”**, the search term language should be **“English”**.
4. Click the **search icon** **🔎** (or press the **Enter** key). Bloom will show you all the images that have been tagged with that keyword.
5. **Select an image** from the results returned.
6. Click **`OK`** to insert the image into your book.
