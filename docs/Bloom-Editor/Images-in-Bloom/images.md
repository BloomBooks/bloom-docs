Images, or pictures, are important to include in books readers in the early grades. Picture books are important for young readers because they build foundational literacy skills, such as vocabulary and comprehension, and support emotional and cognitive development by helping children understand stories and complex concepts. They inspire visual thinking through illustrations, which act as a "visual roadmap" for the text and can aid understanding for pre-readers. Additionally, picture books can foster a love of reading and create a positive bonding experience between children and adults.


Bloom makes it easy to include images in your books.
