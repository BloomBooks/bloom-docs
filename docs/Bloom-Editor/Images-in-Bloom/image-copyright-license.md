Bloom lets you record copyright and licensing information for **each** image in your book.

It is very important that each image in your book have accurate copyright and licensing information! This is **especially** important if you want to share your book with others or publish it on Bloom Library.

If an image does not have copyright and licensing information, Bloom will show a red question mark in the image's upper left-hand corner.
