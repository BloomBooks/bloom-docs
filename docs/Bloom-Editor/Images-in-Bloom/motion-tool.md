The Motion Tool in Bloom allows you to add simple motion to an otherwise still picture in your book. This tool enables you to create a **pan and zoom effect** from one rectangle to another on the image. You can add motion to the first picture on each inside page of your book. This tool is particularly useful for creating engaging and dynamic content that can be viewed using the Bloom Reader app.

### Tips for Using the Motion Tool {#b2b2cd9be37b4eb2a89613e268181632}

- If you change the page size and orientation or choose a different layout after setting the rectangles, you should preview them again. Reposition or resize them if necessary.
- You may notice odd results if only some of the sentences on a page have recorded audio or you have cleared and re-recorded the audio for one sentence in a paragraph. If you see odd results, clear and record the audio again. Then, reposition or resize the rectangles.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the Motion Tool in Bloom to create more dynamic and engaging visual content in your books.
