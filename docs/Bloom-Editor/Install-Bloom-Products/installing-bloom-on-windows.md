## Fonts and Keyboards {#14b4c74f84664b658f7168630913c7d7}


Bloom assumes that you have a way to type your language on your computer. That will often involve using a certain font. SIL offers a free, high-quality fonts for many scripts on its website at [software.sil.org/fonts](https://software.sil.org/fonts).


You may also need a special **keyboard layout** to let you type the characters in your language. **Keyman** is a free program from SIL that has many keyboard layouts. You can get Keyman from [keyman.com](https://keyman.com/).
