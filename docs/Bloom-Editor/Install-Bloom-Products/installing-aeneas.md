This page describes how to install **aeneas** on a Windows computer for use with Bloom. Aeneas is an additional, free software package which Bloom uses to divide recorded audio for a text box into sentence-sized chunks.

## Recording audio by text box {#b5407eb108fb4d97b4d5cea74ab7cb12}


Bloom has two methods for recording audio narration for a book: **by sentence** and **by text box**. Bloom’s usual way of recording narrated audio is one sentence at a time. Bloom will highlight each sentence and allow you to record audio for that sentence.

However, if you record a whole text box at once, the recording usually sounds more natural. If there is more than one sentence in the text box, Bloom uses an extra software package called **aeneas** to split the recording into sentences.

- To enable recording by text box, tick the check box that says `Record by whole text box, then let Bloom split it into sentences later`. Bloom will highlight the entire text box.

- If you do not have the aeneas software package installed on your computer, Bloom will display a warning in the lower portion of the Talking Book tool controls, saying `To split recordings into sentences, first install the` [`aeneas`](https://github.com/sillsdev/aeneas-installer/releases/tag/v1.7.3) `system`.
