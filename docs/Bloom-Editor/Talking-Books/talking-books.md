## Recording Audio by Text Box {#307badfedd994db1abda86d46336fc06}


By default, Bloom records audio sentence-by-sentence. You can also record (or import) the audio for an entire text box, and split the recording into sentence-sized chunks.

### Installing Aeneas {#c72155f3eb0049e6b92e03373dc9a440}


To split a text-box recording into sentence-sized chunks, you must first install a helper program called Aeneas.

### Fine-Tune Audio Timings {#f17df1454d8d466ca03d21c3ddd2cf9c}


If you need to fine-tune the timing of the split recording, you can do with a timings file and the help of an audio editor.
