# About Talking Books {#a544182174f3411fbed34044e720ff5c}


**Talking Books** are digitally published e-books that highlight the text while the recorded narration is played. Text can be highlighted with a background color, or a text color as in this example:

## ePUB vs. BloomPUB {#29a4bb19df128082b416f0930afd6664}


There are two e-book formats for enjoying Bloom Talking Books: ePUBs and BloomPUBs. 


**BloomPUBs** can be read online in [Bloom Library](/what-is-bloom-library), or offline with [Bloom Reader](/about-bloom-reader) or [BloomPUB Viewer ](/bloompub-viewer)for Windows. BloomPUB is the native version to publishing e-books using the Bloom Editor.


**ePUBs** can be read using a wide variety of ePUB viewers. Some ePUB viewers faithfully playback recorded narration; others do not. Please consult [Limitations of ePUB readers](/ePUB-notes).


To understand more about the differences between these two e-book formats, please refer to [BloomPUB vs. ePUB](/compare-bloomPUB-ePUB).
