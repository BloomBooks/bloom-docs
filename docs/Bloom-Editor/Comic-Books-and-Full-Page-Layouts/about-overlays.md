## Limitations of the Overlay Tool {#b9ba640909be49ffb5b9243b1c409b24}


The Overlay Tool provides simple-to-use tools that are “good enough” for most uses, but there are limitations. 

- You cannot put an overlay element on the front cover of a book.
- There are certain limits to layering text and images. See [Notes on “Publish as ePUB”](/ePUB-notes) for details.
