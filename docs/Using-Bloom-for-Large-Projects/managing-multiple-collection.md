Users who are managing a large number of Bloom books may find it helpful to organize their books into multiple Bloom collections. How you organize your Bloom collections will be determined on your goals and unique needs.


For example, if your goal is to produce books which correspond to reading levels 1-4, then it will make sense to have four appropriately named Bloom collections corresponding to that criteria. 


Here are some common ways Bloom users organize their book collections:

- Themes such as “Simple Stories” vs. “Traditional Stories” vs. “Bible Stories”. See [Little Zebra](https://bloomlibrary.org/Little-Zebra-Books).
- Source language.
- Topic.
- Original books vs. Adaptations or translations of the originals.
- Reading Grade Level. See [Education for Life](https://bloomlibrary.org/EFL-education-for-life-org).
- Grade Level combined with source language. See [Okuu Keremet!](https://bloomlibrary.org/kyrgyzstan-OkuuKeremet).

There are no limits to the number of book collections you can create.
