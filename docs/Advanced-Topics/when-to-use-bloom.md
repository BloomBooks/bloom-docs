Bloom is an excellent tool for creating books, but Bloom is not the right tool for every situation. 


# When using Bloom is a good choice {#c3a2873ee2074452abfc5a41d3024a93}


Bloom is a good tool to use under the following circumstances:

- The people writing books have limited computer skills.
- The books people want to create are relatively simple in design.
- People want to adapt existing books to new languages and cultures.
- People want to create decodable and leveled books.
- People want to create “talking books” with a synchronized audio recording of the text.
- People want to create sign language books or books for the visually impaired.
- You want to provide writers with reader templates to help them write books that meet certain specifications.

# When Bloom may not be a good choice {#6814b06dff6b49fab0a1fea3e31eb786}


Bloom is not good for every purpose. Here are a number of needs that Bloom does not accommodate:

- Text does not flow from one page to the next. Rather, Bloom is page-oriented. If authors have more text than will fit on one page, they must stop typing, insert a new page with a text box, and start typing again.
- There are limitations to Bloom's page layout capability: for example, you cannot create a page where text wraps around a picture. You cannot easily create tables with rows and columns. If authors need complex page layouts, Bloom may not be the right tool.
- There are limitations to Bloom's text formatting capabilities: for example, bulleted and numbered lists are not possible.

# Other limitations of Bloom {#45bd439e3f064882828bc31c8f66118f}

- Bloom does not have built-in tools for editing images, audio, or video. Bloom lets you crop an image, but cannot make any other changes to it.
- Bloom only knows four types of content: text, pictures, audio, and video. Bloom books cannot include any other sort of content.
