Reading, writing, and listening to stories in one’s mother tongue is a wonderful gift that promotes human flourishing. This is the core motivation for Bloom. Publishing software is expensive, and commercial publishers are not interested in publishing books in minority languages. Therefore, Bloom’s free and easy-to-use software plays a vital role in giving every language community a fighting chance to make literacy promotion viable.
