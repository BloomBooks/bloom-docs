Reading, writing, and listening to stories in one’s mother tongue is a wonderful gift that promotes human flourishing. That is the core motivation for the Bloom. Publishing software is expensive, and commercial publishers are not interested in publishing books in minority languages. That is why Bloom’s free and easy-to-use software occupies a key role in giving every language community a fighting c<u>hance to make literacy promotion viable.</u> 


<u>Bloom is increasingly becoming the “go-to” tool for promoting grassroots literacy efforts worldwide.</u>


<u>Bloom Library is built on a principle of</u> <u>_generosity:_</u> <u>individuals and organizations</u> <u>_generously_</u> <u>author illustrated books using the Bloom Editor and then upload them to the Bloom Library. In so doing, these individuals and organizations are saying “no” to financial compensation and “yes” to</u> <u>_generosity_</u><u>. The magic then begins as people from around the world click the “Translate into</u> <u>_your_</u> <u>language!” button to begin translating those books. In a short time—and with minimal effort—they can make those books</u> <u>_freely_</u> <u>available to their own peop</u>le in their mother tongue.
