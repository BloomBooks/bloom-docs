## What is a Shell Book? {#a4f834733ad241eea4f4e94e2960d742}


A shell book is a template used to create other books. It sets the page layout, text box locations, pictures, and more. Shell books are not language-specific, meaning they can be used to create books in any language. For more information, see [this Glossary entry](/glossary#a9855df550204e1caffc0d245164ab11).


### Key Features of Shell Books {#f23de047840745d487111816015dd302}

- **Page Layout**: Defines the structure of each page.
- **Text Boxes and Pictures**: Specifies where text and images should be placed.
- **Source Text**: Contains source text that can be translated into other languages.

### Important Note {#9559de174e9b472fb09f45b14edcda93}

- Each Bloom book functions as a small database of texts in various translations.
- Any local language book can be turned into a shell book for other languages. Shell books and local language books have identical formats.
