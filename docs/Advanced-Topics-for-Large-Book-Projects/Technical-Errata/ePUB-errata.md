Fixed vs. Flowable ePUBs  

:::

>Starting with Bloom 5.4, you can have the option of publishing ePUBs in either **Fixed** **layout** mode or **Flowable** mode. In Fixed Layout mode publishing, fully compatible e-readers will display the book exactly like it is shown in Bloom. In contrast, in Flowable mode the e-reader will adjust images and text as it sees fit. Flowable mode ePUBs are helpful when users may wish to adjust the size of the text. Fixed mode ePUBs are an attractive option for landscape books. This is also the only option for Bloom books containing image Overlays like speech bubbles and captions.


There are many ePUB readers available for Windows, Android, iOS and Linux, but these readers vary in their ability to comply with the ePUB3 standard. As a result, you cannot depend on them to faithfully display the contents of a Bloom book, play sign language videos, or to play audio of Bloom Talking Books.


Here are some notes on our testing with various readers:
