A branding pack can fill various slots that are already in a Front/Back Matter pack. It can fill them with an html (text / graphics).

Our built-in front/back matter packs have slots here:

- Front cover top (Bloom 5.3)

- Front cover bottom (Bloom 5.3)

- Credits page top

- Credits page bottom

- Title page bottom

- Outside back cover top

- Outside back cover bottom

In addition, a branding pack can declare:

- Default copyright

- License

- License notes

_Note, when you need something that can’t be done with Branding Packs, then we fall back to making “Custom Front/Back Matter Packs” (sometimes called “XMatter Packs”). For these, we can add new pages, new branding slots, etc. They require a Bloom developer to create for which we bill hourly. They require more effort than you would guess-- at least several hours per page)._

> Branding in Bloom is like decorating a house… it’s easy, but there are limits. In contrast, Custom Front/Back Matter is like moving walls or adding on new rooms.

Here’s are some examples:
