title: Bloom Project Checklist
---


Bloom’s simplicity sometimes masks the inherent complexity involved in book projects that aim to publish hundreds of books per year. This document is meant to guide a conversation between your project team and the Bloom team in order to head off problems long before they threaten to delay your project. After reading and discussing this materially internally, please schedule a call with us to talk over these issues. Ideally, this should happen _before_ you decide to use Bloom.

# Top-up Training for Project leaders

In theory, the Bloom team would provide the software, and other groups would provide the training. However, we find that ultimately, when things go bad in large book projects, it is our team that is called on to provide expert support. In most cases, we find that the problems are caused by the technical leads of book projects who do not have adequate experience or training.

Therefore, after making use of the many Bloom Training services and videos out there, we ask that Enterprise Project leaders spend some Zoom time with a member of the Bloom team _at the start_ of the project. We also ask that once you have produced a few books, allow us to provide you with a free “checkup” so that we can head off any problems while there are just a couple books, rather than hundreds of them.

# Limitations of Bloom books

### Bloom is not suitable for:

- Books with large blocks of text that must flow between pages. (This is a feature that could be funded if there was enough lead-time.)

- Books that rely heavily on tables/grids. (This is a feature that could be funded if there was enough lead-time.)

- Books that require changing paragraph styles at arbitrary points.

### Things you might not know you can do in Bloom:

- Talking books

- Video in books

- Text over picture

- Picture Dictionaries and diagrams

- Interactive widgets

- Full bleed color

TODO: link to examples of books that show all the various surprising things

# Epubs & Their Limitations

- Find out goals/expectations

- Bloom does export to epub, but

	- Epubs are not What You See Is What You Get.

	- Every epub reader has different limitations. None implement the full EPUB. specification. This makes it very expensive for us to verify what results you will get.

	- We do not get analytics from epubs.

	- These limitations are why we offer the free Bloom Reader.

# Image Licensing

Most Bloom book projects want Creative Commons licensing. Adding images which are not CC licensed makes this quite legally murky. Please see our [notes on Image Licensing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R1DKtJv7Bxm_ULGy9K5H89SbYbijUuLcTKyJMzZ1S5s/edit#heading=h.16anob4o4khh).

# Fonts & Their Licensing

Sometimes projects get to the point of publishing to the web, only to find that the font has problems. We have seen:

- a font with murky provenance (probably an illegal ripoff of a commercial font)

- commercial fonts that do not allow us to distribute it for free

- a font we cannot even find on the web

To see if a font can be fully used by Bloom:

Acceptable values are Editable, Installable, Print and Preview. “Restricted” is the one to watch out for.
