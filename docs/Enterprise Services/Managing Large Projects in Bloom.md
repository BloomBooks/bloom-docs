# Key Concepts to Understand

There are a few key concepts to understand about Bloom books.

### Book IDs

The first is that when you make a new book using the Bloom editor by choosing one of Bloom’s book templates, Bloom generates a unique number and assigns it to your book. This “book ID” will continue with that book _wherever_ that book lives and even follows your book if it is uploaded to the Bloom Library.

When you make a _duplicate_ of any book (again, using Bloom editor), a different book ID is assigned to that duplicate.

Likewise, when you make a derivative of a book by clicking on the button, Bloom will assign yet another unique book ID to that derivative.

To ensure that your Bloom books all receive their unique book IDs, it is important to only use the Bloom editor – not Windows Explorer – to create a book, duplicate a book, or make a derivative.

### The problem of error propagation: a caution

One very powerful feature of Bloom is its ability to harness the _generosity_ of its global user-community – book-creators from all over the world – who allow their original works to be freely translated into other languages. And so, a user in (say) India, can create a beautiful book using Bloom, upload it to the Bloom Library, and make it available to the entire world to freely adapt and translate into other languages. It’s wonderful. However, this powerful feature comes with an important caution because once people start downloading and making adaptations of your books, any “mistakes” in your original book will be propagated to those adaptations.

For this reason, _before_ publishing original works to the Bloom Library, you will want to ensure that everything in the book is absolutely perfect: spelling, formatting, logos, copyright, licensing, credits, acknowledgements, audio, etc.

If your book is not yet ready to show to the entire world, but you need some way to share the book with others to review, you may consider uploading it to Bloom Library, and marking the book as a draft:

### Team Collections

Probably the best way to avoid the problem of error propagation is to have many people review your books _before_ they are published. Bloom’s Team Collections feature provides a controlled way for multiple people to make a valuable contribution to a book’s success.

## Choosing an Pre Planning & Organizing

Prior to embarking on a large-scale Bloom project, there are a number of important questions which will determine your approach:

- How many languages do you intend to publish in?

- 

# Two Different Approaches to Publishing Books in Multiple Languages

Several organizations like to publish their books to the Bloom Library in _multiple languages_. We encourage this, but also want to outline two different workflows or approaches and discuss the resulting ramifications of using each approach.

**Method 1: Publish one single book to Bloom Library which contains multiple embedded languages for your original title**

**Advantages**:

- There is only one book folder on your computer to manage for each original book title.

- When published to Bloom Library, your book will automatically become visible in all of the embedded languages.

- It is easy to “tweak” your book and republish it just once, and for that to immediately affect _all_ versions of your book in the various languages on Bloom Library.

- The Bloom Reader version of your book (online or offline) can be viewed in any of the published languages and switched using the built-in language chooser.

**Disadvantages**:

- The online PDF of the book will only be available in a single language.

- The exact same structure of the book – sizing of images and number pages – must suit all of the languages.

Regarding the “tweaking” mentioned above, keep in mind the problem of propagation noted above. If your book is not yet ready to show to the entire world, mark the book as a draft:

Having said that, legitimate “tweaking” of an already published Bloom book might include things like adding the audio narration, or adding a forgotten book acknowledgment, or some other minor change.

**Method 2**: Publish one source language book, and then create derivative copies of the book in other languages

**Advantages**:

- An online PDF will be available for _each_ language.

- The structure of the book – sizing of images and number pages – can be adjusted to suit each individual language.

**Disadvantages**:

- You cannot easily “tweak” all versions by republishing once since there are multiple copies of the book which each need to be corrected.

Now that you understand the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods, let’s talk about how your workflow would differ for each method.

Workflow for Method 1

For this method, you will create just _one_ Bloom collection on your computer which will serve as a “master” collection and it will hold _all_ of your books in _all_ the languages you desire. When you wish to Edit a book in a different language, you will simply switch languages in your collection’s Language Settings. Bloom will then reboot and open your collection in the new language.

Repeat this process until you have completed adding all the languages you desire for a given book.

Once you are ready to Publish your book, set your language setting back to the language you want the book’s PDF available in.

Click Publish, then Share on the Web. Under Upload Text be sure to check all the language boxes you want to become available for your book and be sure to check Narration if you want your audio to become available.

If, at a later date, you need to update your book for whatever reason, you will need to upload the book again. When you do so, Bloom will remind you that your upload will replace the version of the book currently available:

Click Replace Existing to update your book.

Workflow for Method 2

In Bloom, create a separate Bloom collection for _each_ language your organisation is working with.

Then, for each new book you author, you will need to decide which language will be considered the “source” or the “original” language for the book in question. That language choice need not be the same for each book, but if you think you will sometimes be using (say) English as the “original” language for one title, and (say) “French” for some other title, then you will need some system to keep track of where your original book is located, otherwise, you may run into some confusion should you need to revise your book at a later date.

Once you’ve decided the language choice for your new book, open the corresponding language collection and create a new book in that collection. When completed, upload your book to the Bloom Library.

Versions of that book in other languages can then be done by you (or someone else in your organisation) by downloading that book from the Bloom Library into the appropriate language collection and translating it. This book is called a “derivative” and Bloom assigns this “derivative” a unique book ID, different from the original book. So, when this “derivative” is uploaded to the Bloom Library for the first time, it will not replace the original – it will stand on its own.
