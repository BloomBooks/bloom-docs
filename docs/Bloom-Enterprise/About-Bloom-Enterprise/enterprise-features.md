## Activity pages {#5014d1f2248e479787c21b45850417e8}


Bloom supports two kinds of **activity pages** in digital books: Comprehension Questions and Simple Choice Activities.’ 


<div class='notion-row'>
<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>


**Comprehension questions** let you design multiple-choice questions for readers to answer. These activities enhance the reading experience, and Bloom’s analytics system can capture whether readers answer the questions correctly or incorrectly. Such information can provide valuable data for an organization or project’s monitoring and evaluation efforts.

## HTML5 widgets {#b4debe07f92845dea1d78cffbbbef385}


**HTML5 widgets** are JavaScript apps that are programmed outside of Bloom and can be embedded in Bloom book pages. These widgets open up many options for making books interactive.

## Team Collections {#55c8baa318884dcf874c76f7e0dd9859}

## Spreadsheet import/export {#04fd63f5a0fa443bb635115674b580a2}


**Spreadsheet export/import** allows you to export the contents of a Bloom book to a specially formatted Excel spreadsheet, and import the content back into a Bloom book.
