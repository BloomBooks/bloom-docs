When you download a shell book from Bloom Library to translate into your language, the shell book will contain any number source languages you can use to base your translation upon. But once your translation is complete, typically, most of those source languages will not be needed in your published book and should not be included. And so, before you publish your book on Bloom Library, you should think carefully about which languages to include in your book. 


Since the book is already available on the Bloom Library in the source languages you used for your translation, there should be a good reason to include them in your translated version of the book.


:::tip

Please do not automatically include all source languages when you upload your book to Bloom Library; only include the languages that are helpful to your intended readers.

:::




For example, if your shell book had English, French, German and Spanish as source languages, and you just added a Tok Pisin, you should think twice about what needs will be filled by including either the French, German and Spanish. Your main target audience are speakers of Tok Pisin. Few of these speakers would benefit from having the French, German or Spanish included. Possibly, however, including the English will be helpful.


There is no right or wrong answer to such a decision, but the decision should be based on serving the needs of your intended audience.
