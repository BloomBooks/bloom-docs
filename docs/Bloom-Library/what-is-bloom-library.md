**Bloom Library** is a crucial component of the [Bloom Platform](/bloom-platform). It is a free, online collection of open-access books and learning materials, designed especially for early readers and communities with limited access to books. Itâ€™s part of the Bloom literacy ecosystem, developed by SIL Global, a nonprofit focused on language development, literacy, and translation.
