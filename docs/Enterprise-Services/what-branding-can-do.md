A typical Bloom book has prebuilt **content slots** in the front and back matter. A custom **branding pack** can fill these slots with text or graphics to create a consistent branding across a collection of books. 


Standard branding slots include the following: 

- Front cover top
- Front cover bottom
- Credits page top
- Credits page bottom
- Title page bottom
- Outside back cover top
- Outside back cover bottom

In addition, a branding pack can declare:

- Default copyright notice
- Default license notice
- Default license notes

Creating a custom branding pack is a paid service. If you think you need a custom Xmatter pack, contact the Bloom team at [info@bloomlibrary.org](mailto:info@bloomteam.org). 


:::note

You can do a lot with a custom branding pack, there are limits: see [What Bloom branding cannot do](/what-branding-can-do#b681c648ec2e401999e6cefafeb002fa) below.

## What Bloom branding <u>cannot</u> do {#b681c648ec2e401999e6cefafeb002fa}


Making a branding pack in Bloom is like decorating a house: itâ€™s easy, but there are limits. In contrast, making a custom **Front/Back Matter pack** is like moving walls or adding on new rooms. With a custom front/back matter pack (called an **Xmatter pac**k), you can add new front and back matter pages and new branding slots. Custom Xmatter packs must be created by a Bloom developer.


Creating custom Xmatter packs is a paid service. If you think you need a custom Xmatter pack, contact the Bloom team at [info@bloomlibrary.org](mailto:info@bloomteam.org).
